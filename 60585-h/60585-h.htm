<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It is a solemn yet pleasant duty to compile in comprehensive
order the records of a life so eventful and influential
as that of Bayard Taylor. It is solemn, because the sad
tears which began to flow at his death, are coursing freely
still. Pleasant, because there is no task more satisfactory
than that of recounting the deeds of a virtuous, industrious,
heroic life. No test-book of morals, or of general history,
is so effective in educating the young as the annals of well-spent
years, gathered for that purpose. There is more or
less influence in fables and mythological tales; and there is
considerable power in a well written, skilfully plotted work
of fiction; but the direct and unavoidable appeal of a noble
life, which has closed with honor and deserved renown, is
far more potent and permanent in the culture and reformation
of the world, than all other forms of intellectual and
moral quickening. No apology is needed for writing such a
biography. It would be inexcusable to leave the world in
need of it. When the time comes for a book more complete
in its arrangement and details, and more select in its diction,
this will find its proper place in library and reading-room.
Until that time it may be at work renewing the memories of
a friend, refreshing the recollection of his sweet words, and
calling the attention of the stranger to the American who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
has paid to Europe some of the literary debt we have owed
so long.</p>

<p>The writer does not expect that this book will occupy the
permanent place in literature, which he sincerely hopes will
reward those authors who may follow him on this same topic.
Written amid the pressing calls of a busy profession, and
in the season when lyceum lecture engagements, which he
could not postpone, have kept him continually away from
his home; he has attempted nothing more than to give an
outline of a remarkable life, for the purpose of satisfying
the present demand. Errors may be found by critics, such
as all hastily written volumes are liable to contain; but should
this work, as a whole, incline the reader to honor the manhood,
love the poetry, and revere the memory of one whom
the writer for many years has admired and loved, it will
answer the purpose for which it has been written.</p>

<p>The author cannot do less than acknowledge, in this place,
his great obligations to the father and mother of Mr. Taylor,
to Mrs. Annie Carey, his sister, and to Dr. Franklin Taylor,
his cousin, for their generous courtesy and most important
assistance in gathering the facts for this volume.</p>

<p>All the poetical quotations in this book are from Taylor’s
poetical works.</p>

<p>The account of the funeral found in this volume was written
subsequent to the other portions of the work, as the
obsequies and burial took place after the first edition was
printed and sold.</p>

BAYARD TAYLOR.</h1>

<div class="chapterhead">

<p>Mr. Taylor’s Career.—Difficulty and Importance of the Work.—The
Romance of his Life.—Variable Experience.—His Success
as Novelist, Orator, Traveller, and Poet.</p>

</div>

<p>The nearness and magnitude of Bayard Taylor’s life
make it one exceedingly difficult to comprehend and
classify. His adventures were so many, his struggles
so severe, his experience so varied, and his final success
so remarkable, that the materials are too abundant,
and often serve to clog and confuse the student
of his career. An artist who views the mountain
from its base, loses many of the finest effects and
most charming outlines, because of his very close
proximity to them. So, in looking upon the wonderful
career of such a versatile and gifted man, at a time so
near his death, we are less able to form a comprehensive
idea of his life, as a symmetrical whole, than we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shall be when the years have carried us farther away
from him, and the outlines of his greatness are more
distinct. Whether it were better to wait until a part
of the life has been forgotten, and until the more harsh
and angular features have been lost in the general outline,
or whether it were more desirable to describe the
life in all its actual details, and in the natural ruggedness
which the close view reveals, is, however, a mere
matter of taste. To those who love to read of a man
in whose work there was no unevenness and in whose
experience nothing unbroken is seen, the life of one
so long dead that the writer is compelled to fill up
the forgotten years with ideal events and motives may
furnish the choicest theme. But to those students who
love scientific scrutiny, who would estimate the life
for what it is really worth as an example, the biography
which is written amid all the facts, and by one
who comes in actual contact with them, is perhaps
esteemed the most valuable, although, as a whole, less
symmetrical.</p>

<p>Bayard Taylor’s life was rugged and cragged with
startling events, when viewed from the kindly poetical
stand-point of his character. He felt all the extremes
of joy and sorrow. He knew all the pains and honors
of poverty and wealth. He was loved by many, he
was betrayed by many. He lived in the most enlightened
lands, he also sojourned among the most barbarous
people. He saw man in peace and in war. He
rode the ocean in calm and in storm. He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
welcomed guest in the lowliest huts, and in the most
gorgeous palaces. He sweltered in the sands of tropical
deserts, and he was benumbed by the fierce winds
of the Northern ice-fields. He boldly entered the
haunts of wild beasts, and loved the company of
harmless and faithful domestics. He was a man of
many virtues and some faults, each of which made his
life more eventful and fascinating.</p>

<p>The literary position which he held at the time of
his death, and which was so romantically attained, was
one of almost universal favor. He was respected by
all and loved by many. As a writer of fiction he attained
but little celebrity, and it appears that he had
little expectation of achieving any high honors in that
field. As a writer upon travels, and as a delineator of
human character as found in strange places, and in but
partially known countries, he was second to none.
His books upon travel will be read for a century to
come, whether thousands or few visit the localities and
tribes he has described. As an orator, he never held
a high rank. He was chaste, concise, and clear in his
choice of words, and had an incisive, pungent way of
stating his ideas. He could instruct the student and
amuse the populace, but had not the power to agitate
and carry away large bodies of men, and seems
never to have been very ambitious to do so. As a
translator of German literature, he was fast becoming
recognized in all English-speaking countries as an
excellent authority, and it is deeply to be regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that he was called away with so many uncompleted
translation, and unfinished plans for translations, from
the standards of German literature. But it is as a poet
that he receives the greatest homage. Yet how little
he printed! Unless there shall be found laid away
many poems unpublished, he may be classed as one of
the least prolific poets of his generation. His lines
are so simple, so true to life, such incarnate sentences,
so expressive, that, to one who has had a similar experience
with the poet, every stanza is a panorama, vivid
and indelible. We shall see as we pursue the tale, how
sensitive he was to everything poetical, and how deeply
he was moved by all those finer and more subtle emotions,
which only a poet can feel. His love was deep
and abiding. His friendship, like the oaks of his
Cedarcroft woodland. His old home was to him the
sweetest place in all the beautiful lands he saw. His
life was full of romantic incidents, and he recognized
them and appreciated them, for the poetry they suggested.
We venture to say that his poetry will live
in every household, if all his other works should be
forgotten.</p>

<p>German Ancestry.—English Ancestry.—The Pennsylvania Germans.—The
Quakers.—How his Forefathers came to America.—The
Effect of Intermixture of Races.—The Hereditary Traits
seen in his Books.</p>

</div>

<p>The ancestry of Bayard Taylor were connected
with some of the best blood of England and Germany.
His grandmothers were both German, and his grandfathers
both English. The German line comes from
that body of emigrants, consisting of large numbers
from Weimar, Jena, Cassel, Göttingen, Hanover, and
perhaps Gotha, who sailed from Bremen and Hamburg
between 1730 and 1745. The continued quarrels
among the dukes and princes of Germany,—the
wars in progress and impending, wherein the peace
of the people was incessantly disturbed,—caused a
universal uneasiness among the people of those small
nations. They never were quite sure of a day’s rest.
If they sowed unmolested, there was a grave doubt
whether some complication with France, England, or
Poland might not bring foreign invaders or allies to
destroy or devour the crops. The wars were so incessant,
and the quarrels among the petty lords so frequent,
that the people became disheartened. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
were weary of building for others to destroy, and of
rearing sons to be sacrificed to some individual’s
ambition. All those German provinces, or duchies,
had to accommodate themselves to the religion of their
princes, and, at times, the winds that played about the
hills of the Black Forest were far less uncertain. To
the fathers of these emigrants, who sought America as a
haven of religious and political rest, George Fox and
his Quaker disciples had taught the doctrines of “The
Holy Spirit,” and, under various guises, the tenets of
that belief still survived in the German heart.</p>

<p>Those Germans who settled in the counties of
Pennsylvania, lying to the south and south-west of
Philadelphia, came to this country during the disturbances
in the Fatherland, caused by Augustus, Maria
Theresa, Frederick, and the scores of other princes
who were in power, or seeking to secure it, in the
numerous states and free cities of Germany. It is
no light excuse, no desire for mere wealth, no hasty
search for the fountains of youth, that causes the
solid, earnest, patriotic people of Saxony, Baden, or
Bavaria to leave forever the home of their nativity.
It is a little curious to see how these races, which so
cordially and hospitably received the Quaker missionaries
from England, should at last unite with them in
the settlement of the New World, and, by their intermarriage,
produce such offshoots of the united stock
as Bayard Taylor and his cotemporaries.</p>

<p>The Quaker ancestry of the poet,—the Taylors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and the Ways,—run back through a long line of
industrious men and women, more or less known in
Central Pennsylvania, to the colony which William
Penn sent over from England to cultivate the great
land-grant, which King Charles II., of England, gave
him, in consideration of his father’s services as admiral
in the British navy. They, too, were driven from
their homes by the incessant turmoil either of wars or
religious persecutions. Their preachers had again and
again been imprisoned, while some had died the death
of martyrs. Even Penn himself was often in chains
and in prison, for being a peaceable believer in the
truth of the Quaker doctrines; but so blameless were
the lives of these people, and so forgiving their
Christian behavior, that the term “Quakers,” which
was at first applied to them in derision, became at
last a title of respect and honor. “The fear of the
Lord did make us quake,” was a common expression
with George Fox, the founder of the sect, and the
name “Quakers” originated in sneers at that devout
sentence.</p>

<p>It is easy to trace in the history of the State of
Pennsylvania, the influence of the Quaker spirit, and
its impression upon the institutions of the American
nation is also strikingly apparent. But when one
takes up the life of one of their descendants, and
studies his habits, his style of thought, and his ideas
of social and political institutions, the hereditary
Quaker element, in a modified form, is detected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
every motion and expression. It would seem as if
any reader, to whom the author is unknown, would
detect at once, in any volume of Taylor’s poetry or
travels, the fact that he came from Quaker stock. As
will be more clearly shown in a subsequent chapter,
the teachings of the Quakers, and their manner of
expression by gesture and phrase, have unconsciously
and charmingly crept into the bosom of his best
works. It is a great boon to be born of such a physical
and mental combination as that of the German
soldiers, with all their coolness and bravery, and the
even-tempered, God-fearing Quakers, with all their
grace and wisdom. Such intermixture has given to
our young nation much of its surprising enterprise
and originality, and must, at last, when consolidated
into a compact people, produce a nation and a race
wholly unlike any other on the earth.</p>

<p>It is not known that any of Bayard Taylor’s ancestry
were literary men, or that any of them were
endowed with special genius, beyond that which was
necessary to clear the forests, cultivate the soil, manage
manufacturing enterprises, and carry on small
mercantile establishments. Solid people, with wide
common-sense, industrious hands and generous hearts,
they have modestly held their way, doing their simple
duty, and, Quaker-like, making no display.</p>

Village.—His Father’s Store.—Life on the Farm.—Mischievous
School-boy.—Inclination to write Poetry.—Practical
Joker.—Studious Youth.—His Parents.—His Brothers and
Sisters.</p>

</div>

<p>Bayard Taylor was born at Kennett Square,
Penn., Jan. 11, 1825. His mother, whose maiden
name was Rebecca Way, was then twenty-nine years
of age, and his father was thirty-one. The house
then occupied was a two-story stone-and-mortar
structure, such as are yet very common in the farming
regions of central Pennsylvania. The house was
long and narrow, having a porch that extended along
the whole front. The rooms were small and low,
but it was considered by the farmers of that time
as a very comfortable and respectable home. It was
located at the junction of two highways, and near the
centre of the little hamlet called the “Square,” and
sometimes the “Village.” But few families resided
there in 1825, and the people were all more or less
engaged in the cultivation of the soil. The little rude
Quaker meeting-house, so box-like and cold in its
aspect, was doubtless the centre of attraction, and the
desire to be near the house of God, led those devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Quakers to build their dwellings on that portion of
their lands which lay nearest the church.</p>

<p>The village has increased in growth, and now has a
population of six or seven hundred, with several
churches belonging to other denominations, and very
flourishing schools. But the old homestead building,
in which Bayard was born, was destroyed by fire in
1876.</p>

<p>At the time of his birth, his father kept a miscellaneous
stock of merchandise in one room of his
house, and supplied the necessities of the farmers, so
far as the small capital of a country store could anticipate
their wants. Situated thirty-five miles from Philadelphia,
to which place he was compelled to send the
produce he received, and in which place he purchased
his simple stock of goods, the merchant had a
task on his hands which cannot be appreciated or
understood in these days of railways, telegraphs, and
commercial travellers. One of his neighbors, living
in 1872, used to relate how Mr. Taylor, having had a
call for two hay-rakes, which he could not supply,
drove all the way to West Chester, the distance of a
dozen miles, to get those tools for his customer.</p>

<p>At the time of Bayard’s birth, his parents had been
married seven years. Their life had already been
subject to many trials, and was fated to meet many
more. Of a family of ten children, only one-half the
number survived to see mature years. The losses by
mercantile ventures, by failing crops, by sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and accidents, often swept away the hard earnings of
many a month. Yet they struggled on, industrious
and cheerful, keeping themselves and their children
ever busy.</p>

<p>When Bayard was two or three years old, his father
purchased a farm about a mile from the village, and
giving up his mercantile avocations, turned his whole
attention to farming. On that farm Bayard spent the
opening years of his life, and on one section of it did
he build his beautiful home of “Cedarcroft.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The beginning and the end is here—</div>
<div class="verse">The days of youth; the silvered years.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How deeply he loved his home, how sincere his affection
for the rolling fields, the chestnut and the walnut
woodland, the old stone farm-house, the clumsy barn,
the old highway, the acres of corn and wheat, the distant
village and its quaint old church, can be seen in
a thousand expressions finding place in his published
works. His poetical nature opened to his view beautiful
landscapes and charming associations which others
would not detect. The birds sang in an intelligible
language; the leaves on the corn entered into
conversation; the lowing of the cows could be interpreted;
and the rocks were romantic story-tellers.
He loved them all. That farm was his Mecca in all
his travels. When he left, he says he promised bird,
beast, trees, and knolls, that he would return to
them. To the writer, who went to Cedarcroft after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the poet’s death, and who has so long loved and
admired his poetry, it seemed as if the trees patiently
awaited his return. All things in nature must have
loved and trusted him, or they would not have confided
to him so many of their secrets.</p>

<p>Of the pastoral life in Pennsylvania he speaks with
pleasing directness in his volume entitled “Home
Pastorals.” In one place the aged farmer says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Well—well! this is comfort now—the air is mild as May,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet ’tis March the twentieth, or twenty-first, to-day;</div>

<div class="verse">But now I see the furrows turned, I guess it’s dry enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I’m glad I built this southern porch; my chair seems easier here:</div>
<div class="verse">I haven’t seen as fine a spring this five and twenty year.</div>
<div class="verse">And how the time goes round so quick: a week I would have sworn,</div>
<div class="verse">Since they were husking on the flat, and now they plough for corn!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Across the level Brown’s new place begins to make a show;</div>

<div class="verse">When Reuben spread the swath to dry, and Jesse learned to mow,</div>

<div class="verse">But such a man as I was then my boys will never be!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I don’t mind William’s hankering for lectures and for books,</div>
<div class="verse">He never had a farming knack—you’d see it in his looks;</div>

<p>No description in prose can as well describe his
occupation as a boy, as his own lines, in the poem of
the “Holly Tree.”</p>

<div class="verse">From the knoll where stood the house, the fair fields pleasantly rolled,</div>
<div class="verse">To dells where the laurels hung, and meadows of buttercup gold.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such was the farm when he left it, in words of the
poet’s choosing, and what he found when, after a
quarter of a century of wanderings, he can best describe.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There must be many things in the events of common
life which find no voice in poetry, as every life
has its prose side. At all events, there were some
duties connected with agricultural work which young
Bayard never enjoyed. He never was ambitious to
follow the plough, or do the miscellaneous odd jobs
which perplex and weary a farmer’s boy. Yet, like
Burns, he worked cheerfully, and wrung more or less
poetry out of every occupation. He was a spare,
wiry, nervous boy, quick at work, study, or play,
and consequently had many leisure moments, when
other boys were drudging along with ceaseless toil.
His schoolmates, and the only school-teacher now
living (1879) who taught him in his boyhood, all
agree that he was a mischievous boy. He loved practical
jokes, and, in fact, jokes of every kind. But
he was ceaselessly framing verses. When his lesson
was mastered, which was always in an incredibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
short space of time after he took up his book, he
plunged recklessly into poetry. Verses about the
teacher, about snowbanks, about buttercups, about
pigs, about courting, funerals, church services, schoolmates,
and countless other themes filled his desk,
pockets, and hat.</p>

<p>Often he wrote love letters, couched in the most
delicate phraseology, and signing the name of some
classmate to them, would send them to astonished
ploughboys and blushing maidens. One old gentleman
in West Chester, Penn., always claimed that a set
of Bayard’s burlesque verses, sent out in that way,
induced him to court and marry a girl with whom
he had no acquaintance, until the explanation of his
tender epistle was demanded by her father. What
volumes of poetry he must have written, which never
saw the type, and how much more of that which he
was in the habit of repeating to himself was left unwritten!
The life he led, from his earliest school
days, until he was fifteen years of age, was that
of every farmer’s boy in America, who is compelled
to work hard through the spring, summer, and autumn,
and attend the district school in the winter.
The only remarkable difference between Bayard and
many other boys, was found in his strong desire to
read, and his genius for poetry. He gathered the
greater part of his youthful education from books,
which he read at home, and by himself.</p>

<p>He had a noble father, and a lovely mother, God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bless them! and they made it as easy for Bayard as
they could in justice to the other children. They
might not have fully understood the signs of genius
which he displayed; but they put no needless stumbling-blocks
in his way. No better proof of this
is needed, than the excellent record of the other
children, all of whom hold enviable positions in society.
One brother, Dr. J. Howard Taylor, is a
physician, and connected with the health department
of the city of Philadelphia; another, William W. Taylor,
is a most skilful civil engineer; while a third,
Col. Frederick Taylor, was killed at the battle of
Gettysburg, when leading the celebrated Bucktail
Regiment of Pennsylvania. Two sisters are living,—Mrs.
Annie Carey, wife of a Swiss gentleman;
and Mrs. Lamborn, wife of Col. Charles B. Lamborn,
of Colorado. Growing up in such a family,
as an elder brother, involved much patient toil, and
great responsibility. The best tribute to him, in
those days, was paid by an old lady, of Reading,
Penn., who knew him in his youth, and who summed
up her evidence to the writer in the words, “He did
all he could.”</p>

</div>

<p>Joseph Taylor was too intelligent and observing
not to notice how unfit was his son Bayard for tending
sheep, hoeing corn, and weeding beds of vegetables.
The intellectual inclination exhibited by the
boy in every undertaking, and his frail form, led
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor to look about for some
occupation for their son more fitting than the hard
drudgery of a farm. The eagerness with which he
devoted himself to the study of such books as
could then be secured; his schemes for obtaining
volumes considered by his parents, until then, wholly
beyond their reach; his poems and essays, learned in
the hayfield, and written out after the day’s work was
done, all confirmed them in the feeling that it was
their duty to give up his assistance on the homestead,
and permit him to follow the leading of his genius.
It was with no little anxiety that they sent him “away
to school”; for they felt then that they might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have their son, as a companion, at home again. Mr.
Gause then taught an excellent high school at West
Chester, the county seat, and to that they sent him
for a short time. One of his classmates at that school,
now residing in Baltimore, says he remembers distinctly
how awkward and rustic Bayard appeared
when he first entered the school, and how radical and
rapid was the change from the ploughboy to the student.
He became a universal favorite, and was so able
to teach, and so ready to help, that he had a large
number of scholars following him about half the time,
for the purpose of getting assistance at their lessons.
Yet he found much time to read other books than
those containing his studies, and as in a village of the
size of West Chester, there were some small libraries,
his desire for reading could be gratified. Geography
was his favorite study, and, in the pursuit of information,
he sought out and read so many books relating
to the places mentioned in the text-book, that his
classmates used to say that “Bayard knows all about
his geography without even reading his lessons over.”</p>

<p>He was soon well acquainted with the history of
the world, and had the most interesting events connected
with the wars of Europe fresh in his mind.
He read about Edinburgh, London, Paris, Berlin,
and Dresden; of William the Conqueror, Peter the
Great, Charlemagne, and Mahomet; of the adventures
of the Crusaders, of the wars of the Roses, the Thirty
Years’ War, and Napoleon’s campaigns; and, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
each volume, built higher those castles in the air,
which many youths construct on the excitement of
such themes. It seems astonishing how a boy of
fourteen years could appreciate so much of the books
he read, when we recall the dulness and dryness which
characterized almost every history then extant, and
the exceedingly difficult subjects of which they treated.
He read, one day, for a few minutes, in Unionville, in
1839, from a book that lay on the mantel-shelf, and
although the subject was that of art and the beauty of
Raphael’s Madonna and child, he understood it so
well, and remembered it so clearly, that, in 1845,
when at Dresden, where the picture was exhibited, he
was able to recall the words of that description, and
the name of the writer.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which his parents were placed,
made it impossible for them to support him long at
school, neither was he inclined to be a charge upon
them. He desired to be able to earn money for himself,
both to relieve his parents of the expense, and to
furnish means for purchasing books. He was a bold
youth. He seemed to fear nothing. He had a
sublime faith in his own success, which was not egotism
nor pride, but an inspiration. Very often, when
he had read a book, he would sit down and write to
the author; which fact was not, in itself, so astonishing
as the fact that he wrote letters so bright and sensible,
that in nearly every case he obtained a courteous,
and often a lengthy reply. In this way, he made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
acquaintance of many men well known in the literary
circles of America, several of whom were of great
assistance to him a few years after. When he was
but ten years old, and still on the old farm, he read
“Pencillings by the Way,” which was a narrative of
foreign travel, written by Nathaniel P. Willis, and
published in the New York “Mirror,” of which Mr.
Willis was then an associate editor.</p>

<p>Young Bayard soon after entered into a correspondence
with Mr. Willis on literary matters, and continued
the interchange of letters until the death of Mr.
Willis, in 1867. In the same manner young Bayard
secured the attention, advice, and assistance of Rufus
W. Griswold, who edited the “New World” and the
“New Yorker,” and who, in 1842 and 1843, edited
“Graham’s Magazine,” in Philadelphia. Dr. Griswold
was also a poet, and in fact had been in every
branch of literary work, from writing items in Boston
for a weekly paper, through type-setting, reporting,
and compiling, to writing sermons as a Baptist minister.
He had led a wandering life, had seen much of
the world, and was well acquainted, as an editor and
reviewer, with all the best works of history, travel, and
poetry. From him Bayard received much sensible
advice and much encouragement. To him Bayard
sent some of his earliest poems, and thus secured
their publication.</p>

<p>It is probable that Bayard became acquainted with
Henry S. Evans, editor of the West Chester “Village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Record,” through some of his poetical contributions
to that paper. However that may be, he sought the
office of that paper for an opportunity to learn the
printer’s trade, when it had been decided by his parents
to let him go. The “Village Record” had long
been a respected and favorite journal for that county,
and had, under the editorial management of Hon.
Charles Miner, been the intellectual training-school
of many influential and noted men. Mr. Evans was
conducting the paper with much ability, and it was
then usually considered a great opportunity for any
young man if an opening was found for him in the
office of that periodical.</p>

<p>Yet Bayard did not like the work of a printer,
and especially despised the work which naturally fell
to his lot as a new apprentice. He took to sketching;
and having added the instruction of a teacher, for a
few weeks, to a natural tact for drawing, he “illustrated”
almost everything within reach which had a
smooth surface. He caricatured the printers and editors,
and brought out the worst features of his associates
in horrible cartoons. He sent to delinquent
correspondents pictures of ink-bottles and long quills.
He sketched himself in the mirror, and sent the copy
to inquiring friends. Far too intent upon drawings,
poetry, and travels to make much progress as a printer,
he became tired of the occupation and longed to
be free. There came to his hands some time before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he entered the printing-office, a small book, intended
partly for home reading and partly as a guide-book
for European travellers, entitled “The Tourist in
Europe.” It was written by George P. Putnam, of
New York, and told the routes, and described the
wonders to be seen, in a very fascinating way to one
like Bayard, whose imagination was already excited to
the most enthusiastic pitch. The boy appears to have
studied that book with the greatest and most persevering
zeal. He used it for a plan of reading, and
taking it by course, borrowed books relating to the
places mentioned by Mr. Putnam, until one by one
he had learned the history, occupation, literary
achievements, and habits of every city or town of
note in the whole of Europe. He made up his mind
that he was going to Europe. Just how or when was
a mystery. But that he was going soon he had no
doubt. He spoke of his trip to England and Germany
with the confidence of one who has his ticket
and letter of credit already in his pocket. Yet he was
a penniless boy, who had scarcely seen a ship, and
who knew but a few phrases outside of his native
tongue. His friends laughed at him, and gravely told
his relatives that if Bayard did not curb his rambling
disposition he would become a beggar and a disgrace.
Even that chosen schoolmate, whose dark eyes and
tresses held more influence over his thoughts and
movements than the world knew, or he himself would
publicly acknowledge, laughed incredulously as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
told her of his projected visits to the castles, towers,
shrines, and battle-fields of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>The months rolled heavily away, and his fingers
wearied with the type, and his heart became sad because
of the long delay. He began to be ashamed of
his boasts, but patiently waited. For two years he
studied, planned, prophesied, yearned for a trip to
Europe; having in the meantime made a short and
hazardous tramp to the Catskills, with money saved
from his clothing allowance as an apprentice. He
ventured to write to some ship-owners in Philadelphia,
to ascertain if he could work his passage.
He often mentioned his proposed trip to his
employer, and asked to be released from his engagement
and agreement as an apprentice. Mr. Evans
only smiled and said that Bayard need not trouble
himself about that at present; it would be all right
when the time came for him to go. Thus, with a
conviction that he should certainly go, and yet heart-sick
at the delay, Bayard reached his nineteenth
birthday.</p>

</div>

<p>Bayard had a cousin Frank, or Franklin, whom he
held in great respect, and whose subsequent life, as
will be seen hereafter, justified the high esteem in
which Bayard held him. This young man, a few
years older than Bayard, had, by much patience and
perseverance, succeeded in obtaining sufficient money
to support himself in an economical manner in Germany,
and had made up his mind to attend the lectures
at the university in Heidelberg.</p>

<p>“Are you really going, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bayard, I am going sure.”</p>

<p>“Then I am going with you.”</p>

<p>“But, Bayard, how are you going to get the money
to pay your expenses?”</p>

<p>“I do not know where it is coming from, not even
for my outfit, but I am going with you.”</p>

<p>Bayard had written to a great many people, of
whom he had heard, asking them about the expense
and outfit for a tour in Europe. Some of them had
made the journey, and some had completed their preparations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but they all placed the amount so high as
to appear like a fabulous sum to the poor apprentice.
None placed the fare at less than five hundred dollars,
while some of the estimates were as high as eighteen
hundred dollars. Of course this poor boy could
not earn nor borrow either of these amounts. Yet
he was confident that in some way he would be able
to overcome the difficulty.</p>

<p>Dr. Griswold, of whom mention was made in the
last chapter, had suggested that it might be wise for
Bayard to publish, in small book-form, his sonnets and
other poems, and sell them to friends and admirers;
and when he found that Frank was going, he determined
to try that method of raising a little money.
He went to some of his old friends and neighbors for
assistance to print his little volume; but so little was
their faith in the boy they had known from his birth,
that they told him they would not encourage him in
a scheme so absurd and impracticable. But Bayard
only became the more determined with each defeat.
He renewed his application to friends more distant,
and, as is usually the case, he found they had more
confidence than those who looked upon him as the
boy they knew on the farm. From those distant
friends, living in Philadelphia and West Chester, he
at last obtained such assistance as to be able to print
a few copies of his poems. He christened his first
volume “Ximena, and other Poems,” and finding
many kindly disposed persons who would like to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
him to the small sum asked for the book, but who
would have been ashamed to present him with so
diminutive an amount, he was enabled to dispose of
enough in a few days to pay his expenses and a
profit of twenty dollars. Acting upon the advice of
Nathaniel P. Willis, he applied to the editors of the
various newspapers in Philadelphia for employment as
a travelling correspondent; but letters from Europe
were becoming stale, and correspondence was overdone,
so that he was met with discouraging refusals
on every hand. Fortunately, some one suggested to
him the names of the “Saturday Evening Post,” and
the “United States Gazette.” He was, however,
without hope of anything from them. He has since
said to his friends, that he then thought as he could
not fare any worse than he had done, it would do no
harm to try again. His confidence in his final success
was so great, that he had made a settlement with Mr.
Evans, of the “Village Record,” and had left the employment
of a printer before he had found or thought
of a way to secure funds for his intended trip. He had
no money, no outfit, no employment; and yet he was
sure he should go. In that condition, and in a state
of mind bordering on wonder, because the way which
was to open had so long remained shut, this thin,
awkward youth walked confidently into the office of
the “Saturday Evening Post.” Mr. S. D. Patterson
was then its editor, and, while he was disposed to
assist the young man, he did not have much faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his success as a correspondent. Mr. Patterson, however,
gave Bayard some encouragement, and the
youth, with lighter step, went to the office of the
“United States Gazette.” Not finding Mr. J. R.
Chandler at his editorial room, Bayard went to the
editor’s residence. Mr. Chandler was sick in bed;
but he was able to converse with Bayard, and received
him very pleasantly. The young man had never met
Mr. Chandler before; but he stated his cause with such
frankness and clearness, and showed such confidence
in his final triumph, that Mr. Chandler took out his
pocket-book and gave Bayard fifty dollars, saying that
if he sent any letters of sufficient interest they would
be inserted in the columns of the “Gazette.” Mr.
Chandler did not, at the time, care for letters from
Europe, and did not expect to publish any; but, acting
from the promptings of a generous heart, he
freely gave the assistance desired. Of Mr. Chandler’s
honorable career, more will be said in another chapter.</p>

<p>On returning to Mr. Patterson, Bayard found him
willing to do as he had proposed, and the sum of fifty
dollars was added to the gift of Mr. Chandler. Then,
as if fortunes, like misfortunes, come not singly, he
found a customer for some manuscript poems in a
friend of Dr. Griswold,—George R. Graham. From
him Bayard received twenty dollars, making the
round sum of one hundred and forty dollars with
which to begin his journey to the Old World. Bayard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
now felt independent and happy. At least he
could get across the Atlantic Ocean. He might have
to work as a compositor, or as a common laborer, or
even beg for his bread after he arrived on the other
side; he did not know, and seemed to care but little.
He had encountered a hard fortune here, and conquered,
and he felt sure that he could do as well
there. Happy, proud day was it for him when he
returned with the money to his home at Kennett
Square. Sad day for Mary Agnew. But as she and
Bayard were only playmates and schoolmates, she
must not appear to be especially grieved.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to obtain a passport
from the United States Government. It could only
be obtained in Washington, and as they could not
afford the expense of the stages, Frank and Bayard
started for Washington on foot. It would seem as
if such a journey of one hundred and twenty miles,—in
which they walked thirty miles to Port Deposit,
thence in a rickety tow-boat to Baltimore, and from
that city to Washington, they tramped all night without
food or drink,—would have discouraged any one
from attempting to walk through the countries of
Europe. For they must have returned from this first
walk footsore and lame in every joint. Yet they
came back as full of hope as when they started out,
having seen Mr. Calhoun, then Secretary of State,
and many other celebrities then inhabiting the capital
city,—June, 1844.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh! those farewells! To the parents who had
watched over him so long, it seemed like losing him
forever, so far away and mythical did Europe seem to
be. Their lips consented, but their hearts kept rapping
no, no, no, in rebellious throbs. The brothers
and sisters wept with a grief never before so keen,
and a dread never before so deep. But to the youth,
before whom the great unexplored world lay in its
beauty, and who could not then realize, as he did so
keenly afterwards, that in all the world he would find
no spot so sweet and interesting to him as would be
the one he was leaving, it was a joy over which the
sadness of parting for a time was but as the shadow
of a cloud on the summer sea. High hopes, great
aspirations, drove him along, while romantic castles
and fortresses, brilliant rivers, heavenly gardens,
majestic mountains, wise people, delightful music,
gorgeous galleries of art, and indescribable landscapes,
beckoned him to come. Giddy with anticipation,
trembling with conflicting emotions, he stood in
the shade of the oak and the hickory of the old home
that morning, bidding his loved ones good-by. He
was a hero. There was the sense of present loss, and
of danger to come; but it weighed not with him as
against the great ambition of his life.</p>

<p>Did he bid Mary Agnew farewell? Perhaps! The
mature poet will tell us, in his own sweet way, by and
by.</p>

<p>Bayard was not an exception to the universal rule,
found true by nearly every scholar, and every successful
statesman. He was ridiculed by a thoughtless
throng. His success in the matters he undertook subjected
him to the slights and backbiting of envious
simpletons, and everywhere the looks and shrugs of
his acquaintances told with what contempt they
looked upon his endeavors to be a poet, and to see
the world. It was the same old trial, and only those
young men who, like Bayard, are able to stand firm
against ridicule and envy, ever reach the acropolis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
their ambition. No record has been found of the
effect these things had upon Bayard, or upon the two
noble young men who were his companions; but we
do know that they turned not from their purpose.
Bayard’s sensitive nature, his warm heart, his innocent
ambition must have felt the stings, and, at times in
after life, he spoke as one who had not forgotten.
How grand and honorable the exceptional appearance
of the few who were generous and faithful to the poor
boy on the threshold of his life!</p>

<p>Taking with them only such baggage as they could
carry in their hands, these three young men,—Bayard
Taylor, Franklin Taylor, and Barclay Pennock.—started
for New York the last week in June, 1844.
There had been but little delay, notwithstanding the
day for departure had been set before Bayard knew
where the funds were to come from to defray his
expenses.</p>

<p>There was a strong hope in Bayard’s mind that Mr.
N. P. Willis, who had written him such encouraging
letters, would be able to assist him in securing
employment as a travelling correspondent of some
of the New York daily papers. Mr. Willis was
widely known, and greatly respected in New York,
and, on the arrival of Bayard at his office, he entered
heartily into the work of procuring such a situation
for his young friend. But foreign correspondence
had been as much overdone in New York as in Philadelphia.
So many writers had tried to make a name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by imitating the first successful correspondents, that
the people were weary with the monotonous story.
It was as well known then as it is now, that copyists
and imitators are not what a live, active, original newspaper
requires. Correspondence from almost anywhere
could be made interesting and amusing, if the
writer would only write naturally, and describe the
things he saw in just the light they appeared to him.
No one thought that this boy would do anything else
but follow in the old track. Hence they wished for
none of his writings. One gentleman told him that
it was useless to make engagements, for a youth,
going into a strange country in that hap-hazard way,
would not live to write any letters. Mr. Willis’
generous assistance availed Bayard nothing with a
people who had so often been compelled to form their
own opinion of the people they wished to employ, and
who considered themselves the best judges.</p>

<p>In the editorial room of the New York “Tribune”
sat the editor, whose name is being written higher, on
the list of America’s great men, by every succeeding
year. To his quick eye, there was promise of noble
things in the countenance of the boy. He had himself
been a venturesome, ambitious, penniless boy, and,
like Bayard, he had boldly pushed his boat into the
dangerous billows. He may have remembered Benjamin
Franklin’s hazardous trip, as a boy, to Philadelphia,
for Bayard was mentioned by Mr. Willis as
a young man from the Quaker city. Whatever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
have been his thoughts, he treated Bayard with his
usual consideration, and informed the youth that he
was ready to publish and pay for all letters that were
worth inserting in the “Tribune.” But he solemnly
warned Bayard against attempting to write anything
until he knew enough about the country to write
intelligently. Bayard told Mr. Greeley that he would
try to get acquainted with the people of Germany and
their institutions, and, as soon as he felt competent,
would send a few letters for Mr. Greeley’s criticism.
The busy editor nodded as the boy thanked him,
bade him good-day, and, doubtless, instantly forgot
there had ever been such a visitor; and left the fact
in oblivion, until it was brought to mind some months
afterwards by the arrival of a letter from Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis told Bayard, as he said afterwards, to
keep up his courage, and go forward: “The way to
Valhalla is broad and smooth to the hero, but narrow
and dangerous to the coward.” It appears by the
brief account which is given in the introduction to
his “Views Afoot,” published by Putnam &amp; Sons,
New York, that the party had a difficult task to find
a vessel in which the accommodations, rates of passage,
and port of destination were within their plan.
They intended at first to take a vessel direct for the
Continent; but in such of them as were bound for
continental ports, the fare was too high. They
were, however, on the point of taking passage in a
Dutch sailing vessel, the consignees of which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
acquaintances of Mr. Willis, and consequently made
some reduction in the fares, when an opportunity
offered itself for a steerage passage in a vessel bound
for Liverpool. In that way, they would be conveyed
to England for the sum of twenty-four dollars. But
such a passage! Think of it, ye disconsolate, fault-finding
tourists, who lie in the soft beds of a steamer,
with fresh air and plenty of light! Think of it, ye
sufferers that occupy the great forward hall of a
steamship, and who curse your fate that you are
compelled to take a steerage passage! What would
you do or say should you be crowded into a cabin of
rough planks, eight feet long, and seven feet wide,
with nine passengers and eight narrow berths, in a
clumsy, dirty little sailing vessel? Yet this was the
young adventurer’s choice, rather than expend the
small sum of twenty-five dollars from his small store.
These three boys were compelled, by the terms of
passage, to furnish their own provisions and bedding,
and the fact that the unexpected honesty and kindness
of a warehouse clerk prevented their starting off without
enough food to last through the voyage, is another
proof that “fortune favors the brave.”</p>

<p>As there was one more adult passenger in the
steerage than there were berths, Bayard and his cousin
Frank good-naturedly agreed to occupy one together.
To the writer, who has frequently crossed the treacherous
Atlantic, there seems to be no experience so inconceivably
miserable and sickening as a steerage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
passage in a sailing vessel must be to the landsman.
But when to the usual discomforts of dampness, darkness,
sea-sickness, and strange company, are added
the cramps caused by being packed with another
passenger like a sandwich into a narrow box, and the
absence of fresh air, no tortures of the Inquisition
would seem to equal it. Bayard often referred to his
first discouraging sensation of sea-sickness. Coming, as
it always does to the passenger, just as he is taking his
last sad look at the fading shores of his native country,
it is always a disheartening experience. Bayard shed
tears as he began to realize that he was actually afloat
upon the wide ocean, and could not if he would
return to the land. He has since well said, that had
he known more of life, and the dangers of travel,
his alarm and discouragement would have been much
greater than they were, and of longer duration.
Youth borrows no trouble; hence it is happy and
victorious.</p>

<p>Of that voyage, and its sufferings, in the ship
“Oxford,” beginning on the first day of July, and
ending at Liverpool on the twenty-ninth of the same
month, he made but brief mention; yet his experience
in getting the ship’s cook to boil their potatoes, in
eating their meals of pilot-bread, and in the company of
their English, Scotch, Irish, and German cabin-mates,
was most charmingly told in his letters to the “Gazette”
and to the “Post,” as well as in “Views Afoot,” to
which reference has already been made. His German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
companion was not only a social advantage, but furnished
the adventurous youths with a pleasant opportunity
to get some of the German phrases, and to hear
descriptions of the country they were to visit. They
were also favored by the captain’s permission to use
books from the cabin library, which contained several
entertaining books of travel and of fiction. The closing
days of the voyage appear to have been pleasant in
some respects, for the beauty of the sea made a lasting
impression upon his mind, and might possibly have
been still in his memory when he wrote the lines in his
“Poems of Home and Travel,” running thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The sea is a jovial comrade,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He laughs wherever he goes;</div>
<div class="verse">His merriment shines in the dimpling lines</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That-wrinkle his hale repose:</div>
<div class="verse">He lays himself down at the feet of the Sun,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And shakes all over with glee,</div>
<div class="verse">And the broad-backed billows fall faint on the shore</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In the mirth of the mighty Sea.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be that the beauty and joy of the sea appeared
more remarkable because of the great contrast
between its free and wild life, and the crowded and
stifled existence of the mortals who witnessed its gambols.
At all events he was not so delighted with the
sea that he could not shout with the others, when the
dark outlines of Ireland’s mountains appeared through
the mist. The sleepless nights, the company of howling
Iowa Indians, the musty cabin, the terrible nausea—all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were forgotten in the sight of land, and as the goal
grew nearer, the more like a dream became all the
disagreeable experiences of the voyage, until when,
after tacking from northern Ireland to Scotland, from
Scotland to Ireland, and from Ireland to the Isle of
Man, they sailed up the Mersey to Liverpool, the inconveniences
of the voyage had wholly faded out, and
only the few agreeable incidents remained a reality.
They passed the dreaded officials of the custom-house
without difficulty, and by the advice of a “wild Englishman,”
who was one of their travelling companions,
they went to the Chorley Tavern, and there enjoyed a
bountiful dinner, as only passengers by sea can enjoy
them when first they step on shore. Bayard was impressed
by the sombre appearance of the city, and
amused by the use of the middle of the streets for sidewalks,
and by the pink each man carried in his buttonhole.</p>

</div>

<p>Bayard and his companions, including the German
student, with whom there had sprung up an intimate
friendship, left Liverpool on the same day on which
they arrived there, having found that they would reach
Scotland <i lang="la">via</i> the Giant’s Causeway, as soon as they
could by waiting for the more direct line. With an
exercise of common-sense, such as characterizes too
few Americans in this day of fashionable travel, they
took passage second-class, finding themselves in no
way the worse for the temporary inconvenience, while
their fare was but one-sixth the amount of a first-class
passage. It was not a comfortable night’s voyage on
the way from Liverpool to Port Rush, in the north of
Ireland, starting at ten o’clock in the evening, and
arriving at eleven o’clock the next night. It may
be that the cold and wet, the crowd of Irish passengers,
the unvaried diet of bread and cheese, served the
purpose of making the shores and bluffs more attractive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as the mind naturally seeks and usually obtains some
comfort and recreation in the most doleful surroundings.
It is a glorious thing to look upon those basaltic
hexagons of the Giant’s Causeway, under any circumstances.
Those enormous natural columns, set side by
side, so close as to make a floor along their tops, so
strange, so unaccountably symmetrical, fill the soul with
awe, and half persuade the least credulous beholder
that there were giants in the days of yore, and that
they really did build a thoroughfare of these huge
prisms across to Scotland. Any traveller contemplates
those matchless piles with surprise, and every
sojourner is delighted beyond estimation by the contour
and echoes of the vast caverns, into which the
ocean rolls with such enchanting combinations of sound
and motion. But to young men who had seen but
little of the world and its natural wonders, and who
had suffered a kind of martyrdom for the sake of visiting
them, those resounding caverns, and those mighty
ruins of gigantic natural temples, must have been
inspiring beyond measure. Every traveller recalls
with the most clear and grateful remembrance, the first
landscapes of Europe, on which rest his ocean-weary
eyes. To these young men the landscapes were about
their only joy, and they appreciated them accordingly.
Bayard seems to have been very enthusiastic. He
scrutinized everything and questioned everybody. He
let nothing pass him unnoticed, although in his books
he left much unmentioned. He clambered into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
lofty recesses of the Causeway, and let himself down
into the strange niches. He halloed in the caves for
the thundering echoes; he drank three times at the
magical Giant’s Well. He strayed from the highway
that led from Port Rush to the Causeway, to look into
the weird nooks which the sea has carved in the
mutable shore. Dunluce Castle, with its broken walls
and ghastly towers—home of proud Lord Antrim—and
home as well of that family’s terrible banshee, was
the first old ruin which Bayard visited. It stands on
the verge of the cragged cliffs, with the sea beating
about its base, and bellowing in the cavern under it.
It is located near the highway which leads from Port
Rush to the Causeway. Across the narrow footway,
and into these ruins, Bayard rushed most eagerly.
The same old man who now shows travellers the battlements,
and tells to wondering hundreds the tales of
tournament and banqueting-hall, was there then, and
rehearsed the tale to him. The boy is gone. But
the old man, whom Bayard mentions as an old man
then, lives on in his dull routine, yet living less in a
half century than Bayard lived in a single year.</p>

<p>All this was fresh and glorious to the youth, and
gave him a very pleasant foretaste of the rich experiences
in store for him. But, as if the fates conspired
to chill his intellectual joys with physical discomforts,
a rain came pouring upon them as they returned, the
wind blew in fierce gusts, darkness, deep and black,
settled upon the land; they lost their way, and floundered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
about in muddy ravines, and barely escaped
destruction as they trod the edges of the precipices
above the wildest of seas. They became separated
from each other, and the howling of winds and waves
among the crags was so hideous that they could not
for a long time hear each other’s call, and the worst of
fears for each other were added to their own dismay.
But they somehow blundered upon the path as it
emerged from the wild rocks, and together walked
the beach to their hotel, soaking and half frozen.
But all those trying experiences fade when the skin is
dry, and the sweet sleep of healthy youth comes with
its comforting oblivion; only the gorgeous landscapes,
and the romantic places, like the memories of boyhood,
remain to shape the dreams.</p>

<p>Bayard was shocked by the miserable condition of
the Irish peasantry, and his description of their huts,
and their appearance, given in his letters, shows great
sympathy for their distress, and great disgust at their
degraded customs. On his way to Greenock from
Port Rush, he fell in with a company of them, who
chanced to take the same steamer, and he did not
enjoy their drunken and beastly songs and riots. But
on his trip from Greenock, up the Clyde to Dumbarton,
he had more acceptable companionship, and in
his book he refers, with a most touching simplicity, to
the music of a strolling musician on board the boat,
who played “Hail Columbia” and “Home, Sweet
Home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Scotland! Noble old hills! Charming lakes,
and enchanting valleys! How like the awakened
memories of loved faces, they come back to us when
we hear the word “Dumbarton”! What exciting tales
of Baliol, of Wallace, of Bruce, of Queen Mary, of
Cromwell, come again as we recall the sugar-loaf
rock, on which the remnant of the old fortress stands!
Those bright youths must have feasted on the associations
connected with Dumbarton. As they peered
from Wallace’s tower, handled Wallace’s sword, and
gazed over the wide landscape, with the sites of
battle-fields, castles, palaces, the home of Bruce, the
cottage of Wallace, the beautiful valleys of the Clyde
and Leven, the majestic Ben Lomond, and the crests
of the Highlands, they grew in intellectual stature,
and breathed a moral atmosphere as pure as the air
that encircled the flagstaff at the summit. There is
no education like the actual contact with the scenes
connected with heroic self-sacrifice, to train young
men for patriots and poets. No discipline is more
necessary to the development of a broad and virtuous
manhood among any class of young men, than studious
travel in foreign countries. To young Bayard, lacking
other culture than the few years at the district school,
the few months at the academy, and the studious
perusal of histories and poems, this experience was
of vast importance. Its beneficial effects were seen
throughout his life, and frequently show themselves
in his editorials, poems, novels, and narratives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>At Dumbarton, Bayard had his first narrow escape,
and he said that when he reached the ground, after daring
to scale, for flowers, the precipice up which Wallace
climbed with his followers for glory and fatherland, he
was in such a tremor of terror, in view of his having
so narrowly escaped death, that he could scarcely
speak. The unusual strength of a little tuft of wild
grass, growing in a crevice of the cliff, had saved him
from being dashed to pieces. It must have given him
a very vivid impression of the daring feats of those old
Scotch warriors, who not only faced these perpendicular
walls, but fearlessly encountered the foes at the top.</p>

<p>From Dumbarton, Bayard and his friends walked
through the valley of the River Leven to Loch
Lomond. All his letters and contributions to the
newspapers speak of this walk as one of the most
enjoyable of all his rambles. In his “Views Afoot,”
with which every reader is or should be familiar, he
mentions it as a glorious walk. The pastoral beauty
of the fields, the clearness of the stream, the ivy-grown
towers, the dense forests, the early home of
Smollett, whose dashing pen astonished the kingdom
in 1748, the summer parks of Scottish noblemen, the
mild, soothing August sunshine, were a combination
rarely found, and when found as rarely appreciated.</p>

<p>These young travellers had been diligent readers,
and, when the steamer hurried them over the lake,
the appearance of Ben Lomond and Ben Voirlich, of
“Bull’s Rock,” and Rob Roy’s Cave, of Inversnaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Glen Falloch, called up the shades of the Campbells,
Macgregors, Malcolms, Rothesays, Macfarlanes,
Macphersons; making each beach and rock along
Loch Lomond a feature of romantic interest.</p>

<p>With youthful enthusiasm, Bayard clambered to the
rugged top of Ben Lomond, having waded through
deep morass and thorny thicket, to reach it, and, from
that lookout, gazed around on the peaks of lesser
mountains, down upon the sweet Lomond lake, away
to the oceans on either side of Scotland, discerning
the smoke over Glasgow, the dark plains of Ayr,
and, but for a mist, the embattled towers of Stirling
and Edinburgh. After a short stop, he descended
with his old companions, and a new one (he was constantly
finding new friends), along the slippery, stony
slopes; and, after a dinner of oatmeal cakes and milk
at a cottage near the base, trudged and waded on
through that wild tract of woodland and swamp to
Loch Katrine. There was the home of poetry. The
great forests, through which the Clan-Alpine horns had
echoed, the dense forest, through which the scarfs and
bows did gleam in the old days of the Highland clans,
had disappeared. The blossoming heather and bare
rocks made a sorry substitute. But to Bayard,
whose life was set to poetry, who had so often studied
and declaimed of Fitz-James and Roderick Dhu, and
who had often dreamed of the Ellen’s Isle, and the
gathering clans, as Walter Scott described them, it
must have been an enchanted spot. One may recite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and analyze for half a century that poem, and may flatter
himself that he has detected all its beauty, and understands
all its historic references; but one hour on
Loch Katrine is worth more than all that. There the
reader <em>lives</em> the poem, and it is a part of his being
ever more. Bayard felt compensated there for all the
sufferings, by sea and by land, which he had experienced.
He gazed fondly upon the glassy, land-locked water;
he studied closely the features, manners, and songs of
the Highland boatmen, those descendants of the old
clans; he sketched, with the keenest interest, Ben
Ann, Ben Venue, the gate of the Trosachs, and the
curved lines of the sandy shore, and he awoke the
echoes at the Goblin’s Gave and Beal-nam-bo. Rich
experiences! In such does the youth develop fast into
a cultured manhood.</p>

<p>From Loch Katrine, the party walked by way of
Loch Vennachar, Coilantogle Ford, and Ben Ledi, to
Doune,—the home of royalty during the sixteenth
century, and whose old castle is still a majestic ruin.
Thence through the plains to Stirling Castle, crowned
and battle-honored, and looking down on the valleys
of the Forth and Allan Water, and out upon the
bloody fields of Bannockburn and Sheriff-muir.
Having inspected the dungeons and halls of the
castle, looked with horror upon the spot where
royalty murdered a friend, and threw the body to the
dogs; and after contemplating the grave of the girlish
martyrs, they hastily took the shortest route to Glasgow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and thence to the home of Burns, where a great
celebration, or memorial gathering, was to be held, to
honor the memory of the “rustic bard,” on the banks
of his own “Bonnie Doon.”</p>

</div>

<p>Bayard’s visit to Ayr was the first of a long series
of like visitations to the homes of celebrated poets, and
being then a novel experience was doubly enjoyed. It
may be that the similar occupation, and like inspiration,
which characterized both himself and Burns, made the
spot more attractive. Had they not both followed the
plough through the thick sward? Had not both milked
the cows; drove the horses to the water; planted the
corn; dug up the weeds; cut the hay, and all the
while sang and recited original verses? Had he not
been ridiculed by his playmates, and sneered at by his
neighbors, in common with that great poet of Scotland?
To look over the farm on which Burns toiled; to be
shown the spot on which it is claimed Burns overturned—</p>

<p class="noindent">the home of the “mousie,” and to be shown the
cottage he was born in, and the scenes which inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his songs, interesting as they are to the writer
of prose, must have been peculiarly satisfactory to
him. He does not speak of it, however, with the
enthusiasm one would expect, and it is quite probable
that he was not yet wholly inured to the inconveniences
of a wet climate, and could not think or
muse in a crowd as satisfactorily as when dry and alone.
When he arrived in the town, the streets were filled
by an immense throng, and there could have been little
satisfaction in trying to fall into poetical dreams. It
is a great satisfaction to those of Bayard’s friends who
have loved him, and put their faith in him, to know
that he put himself on record in some of his early letters,
in no light terms, as having an unutterable
disgust for the drunken brawling which went on in the
name of Burns that day in Ayr. He felt, with great
keenness, the disgrace which every American feels that
it is to Scotland, that the old cottage, so sacred for its
associations as the birthplace of Burns, should be
occupied as a drinking-saloon, and be crowded with
intoxicated vagabonds. It seemed like making a dog-kennel
of a chapel in St. Paul’s. Anything but genius,
intellect, or wit characterizes the crowd that usually
frequent Burns’ Cottage on such days; and it is said to
have been, in 1844, the resort of a more beastly class
than are those wretches who get intoxicated there now,
and, naturally, on such a great day as that on which
Bayard visited it, every Scotsman who indulged at all
became furiously drunk. Besides that inconvenience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the trustees of the monument, on the day when so
many thousands came to see it and its treasures, voted
to lock it up; and Bayard, with the others, was shut
out from its interesting collection of relics and mementoes.
Still further, it was so arranged by the marshals
of the occasion, that the grand stand, with its literary
feast and the ceremonies appurtenant to the occasion,
were shut out from the populace to whom the poet
sang, and Bayard being only a strange boy, with no
more of a title than Robert Burns had, was obliged to
content himself with a seat on the ridge of the “brig
o’ Doon.” He did see old Alloway kirk, and heard
its bell. He saw within its ruined walls the rank
weeds, and without, the graves of the poet’s ancestry.
He did have a cheerful pedestrian tour; for the home
of Burns, with Alloway kirk and the bonnie Doon, are
three miles from the city of Ayr in open country.
He saw the sister and sons of the poet. He heard the
assembled thousands sing, “Ye banks and braes’ o’
bonnie Doon.” He saw a grandson of Tam O’Shanter.
He had to walk the three miles, returning through
mud and rain, and he had to stand in an open car,
exposed to a driving rain-storm, throughout the two
hours’ ride by railroad to Glasgow. How different his
reception then, as a boy and unknown, from that which
he received in his riper age, after his fame was secured,
at the home of Germany’s greatest poet.</p>

<p>We follow Bayard in his first tour in Europe with
greater detail than we shall do with other journeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
because in this he developed so much of that character
which made him famous. History being written, not
for the dead, but for the instruction and encouragement
of the living, should show clearly how a great life
was attained, as a guide for similar genius in the days
to come. In a volume of hasty sketches like this, we
cannot hope to do the work as thoroughly as we should
so much love to do it; but as far as can be done at
this early day, we give those events which had the
greatest effect upon his life as a writer of prose and
poetry.</p>

<p>He must have feasted in Edinburgh. Richest storehouse
in Scotland, for all such as follow letters! There
was the monument to Scott, suggestive of the most
beautiful in art, but so insignificant as a reminder of
him, while the walls of Salisbury Crags, and the dome
of Arthur’s Seat, frown beyond and above it. There
was Holyrood Palace, with its stains of blood, the
couch of the beautiful queen, and the collections of
historical relics. No place but the Tower of London
has received such attention from gifted and famous literary
men. Historians, poets, philosophers, educators,
preachers, and lawyers have written and discoursed
upon it. There was Calton Hill, with its monuments
to great men. There was the great University, and
there was the old Castle, that sat like a crown on the
head of the city. All had been described by the most
facile pens. All were full of living interest, and when
Bayard tried to describe them, he found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
attempting to compete with the greatest essayists of
the English-speaking world. The Grass Market, where
Porteous was executed; Cowgate Street, with its aristocratic
associations; St. Giles’ Church, with its memories
of John Knox and the Heart of Mid-Lothian, were
described by him, about which it is a kind of literary
sacrilege to speak in other than classic language. It
was a school that included every other, and Bayard
was an apt and diligent scholar.</p>

<p>A short distance from Edinburgh, the pedestrians
saw the birthplace and hermitage of Drummond. It
is a delightful, sequestered chateau, called “Hawthornden,”
and in it the poet wrote nearly all his
elegant sonnets, and it was there that old Ben Jonson,
after a walk from London, was entertained by
Drummond, and Drummond was in turn entertained
by Jonson. Going by the way of Galashiels and
Selkirk, the party visited Abbotsford and its environs,
where the immortal Scott lived and wrote. In the
beautiful mansion which Scott built, and in which he
wrote his most popular works, they read his manuscripts;
sat at his desk; wandered in his gardens;
gazed intently over the wide lawn and the distant
Tweed; scrutinized the enormous variety of relics
which had been collected by that antiquarian, to whom
kings and queens were glad to become tributary.
Thence they walked along the hard and smooth highway
to old Melrose.</p>

<p>Ruins they would see in the near England, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the distant continent, which would enclose a dozen
abbeys such as this; Gothic arches they would enter
which would make those of Melrose seem as a toy; and
ivy and carving and chancels would be noticed, so
much more rich and beautiful, that these would suffer
sadly if put in comparison. But nowhere else in all
the wide world would they find a locality made more
interesting than this. The associations are almost
everything. And to the initiated, the great magician,
Scott, still speaks in the groined arches, flowering pillars,
old clock, and willow-like windows. Melrose
Abbey is a marked illustration of the power of a
master-mind to give influence, life, and interest to
inanimate things. Bayard felt this truth and mentioned
it. He read “The Lay of the Last Minstrel” in
the shadow of the arches, and imagined how the ruins
glowed when the grave of the wizard opened and the
book was revealed. Who knows but it was there, in the
presence of those stirring associations, that he first conceived
the plan which led him to make classic in poetry
and fiction the fields, hills, and Quakers of his native
county. Had he lived ten years longer than he did,
his loved Kennett might have been as classic in song
and story as Abbotsford itself.</p>

<p>From Melrose the young pedestrians walked to Jedburgh,
omitting the delightful excursion to Dryburgh,
but passing the home of Pringle, who had been the
founder of “Blackwood’s Magazine,” and who had
been also a poet and wanderer like Bayard. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
passing the Cheviot Hills, the party met an excursionist
in a carriage, fast asleep, which appeared to amuse
Bayard very much. Probably he afterwards saw more
amusing scenes than that, wherein travellers did not
appreciate their privileges. The writer, as late as the
summer of 1878, saw an American who had worked
most industriously to lay up the funds to visit Switzerland,
ride up the entire ascent of the glorious Alps at
St. Gothard, on the top of a coach, fast asleep. Such
marvels does the world of humanity contain. Bayard
did not sleep when anything of interest called upon
him for investigation, nor when the beauties of nature
were to be enjoyed. They crossed the border between
Scotland and England, over the battle-fields of the
Percys, and by streams that were often, in days past,
actually swollen with blood. There, “Marmion,” with
all its tales historical, and legends mythical, was quoted
and <em>lived</em> as only the cultured traveller can live it.
There was instruction in every scene, every stranger,
and every inn. How well Bayard availed himself of
their lessons, is illustrated in all his excellent letters
on foreign travel, and in his books compiled from them.
At Newcastle he noticed a group of miners begging in
the streets, and when he heard how they had struck
for higher wages, because they could not longer exist
on the pittance allowed them, and how they and their
families were turned out upon the streets to starve, his
indignation was very great, and in his book he utters a
prophecy that soon that murmur from the oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
people would increase to a roar, and be heard “by the
dull ears of power.” From Newcastle he went by boat
to London, reaching that city in the early morning near
the end of August.</p>

<p>London is a world in itself, as has often been written
and, to such an impressible mind as that of
Bayard, was a place, replete with pleasure and instruction.
London instructs by two methods; one by
agreeable, and the other by disagreeable examples.
Bayard was equally taught by both. There was Westminster
Abbey, with its numberless tombs of the talented
and noble; and there was the Tower of London,
with its dungeons and beheading blocks. There were
the palatial residences of the West End, and there the
hovels and holes of the Wych Street district. There
were the great mercantile houses of Holborn and Regent
Street, and there were the gambling dens of Drury
Lane. There were the magnificent galleries of art, at
the Museum, at the Palaces, at Westminster, and at
Kensington; and there were the dirty, slimy exhibitions
of marred humanity along the wharves of the Thames.
There were the zoölogical wonders of the parks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
there were the dog-shows, and cock-pits of the St.
Giles Rookery. There was the palace of the Queen,
and there the Old Bailey. There was the office
of the “Thunderer” (Daily Times), and there were
the attics from whence flowed the vilest trash that
man ever printed. There were Hyde Park, Regent’s
Park, St. James Park, and the broad squares; and
there were the filthy alleys and narrow lanes about
London Bridge. There were the Rothschilds, and
there the poor Micawbers and deserted Nicholas
Nicklebys. The richest, the poorest, the best, the
worst; the most cultivated, and the most ignorant;
the most powerful monarch, and the most degraded
fishmongers. Extremes! Extremes that meet in
everything there. They all instruct by teaching the
beholder what he ought to be, and what he ought not
to be. One sees much in London that ought not to
have been; and, strange to relate, many of the relics
connected with such things, are exhibited with great
pride. If there is any one thing above all others, for
which the American should be thankful, it is for the
fact that the dungeon, the rack, the wheel, the thumbscrew,
the guillotine, the gibbet, the headsman’s block,
the deadly hates of royalty, the cruelty of kings, and
the jealousy of queens, have no place in the history
of the Republic of the West. Yet there, somehow,
the officials and guides who open to the public the
records of the past and show visitors their institutions,
give the most prominent places to deeds of horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
cruelty and shameless murders, as if they took pride
in such fearful annals. It would seem as if, had our
rulers butchered in cold blood their sons and daughters;
had they cruelly starved their friends and relatives,
we in America would be ashamed of it. It would be
regarded as very natural here, if an ancestor was hung
and quartered and his head carried about on a pole,
to speak of it as seldom as possible. It would appear
consistent if, had our national government oppressed
the weak, degraded the poor, killed inoffensive captives,
and, for selfish ambition, laid waste the cities
and fields of an innocent people, we should attempt
to bury the remembrance of those deeds so deep as to
make a resurrection impossible. But there, in Europe,
they appear to revel in the hideous doings of their
ancestors, and will show you where human heads or
bands were exhibited, and where noble men and
women were persecuted to martyrdom, with the air
of the circus manager who announces the clown.
Who can hear the guide on London Bridge, “Here
was posted the bleeding head of Sir William Wallace,
the Scotch warrior and patriot, while the quarters of
his body were at Stirling, Berwick, Perth, and Newcastle,”
and not curse, with the deepest feeling, the
people who murdered one of the greatest and best of
men?</p>

<p class="caption">TOWER OF LONDON.</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear that these things made a strong impression
upon Bayard, for we find him more frequently and
more decidedly praising his own land, as he saw more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and more of Europe. He saw, also, many of the
advantages which European nations enjoy in art,
literature, and commerce, and failed not to suggest
them to his readers. But, unlike those shallow tourists,
who would ape European manners, and think
all European institutions should be at once imported
here, his patriotic regard for the institutions and people
of his own land, increased with the desire to
benefit them. How reverently he speaks of George
Washington; how touchingly does he speak with the
European peasants who accost him, of the home of
the free beyond the great ocean.</p>

<p>A whole week those young men searched the great
city for valuable information. They slept and ate in
the rudest of taverns, and tramped the city with the
workmen and the beggars, but they were gathering
the forces for a useful life. Bayard was filled with the
sublimity of the mighty human torrent that, like a
tide, rolls into London in the morning, dashes about
the highways during the day, and surges outward at
night. He felt the grandeur of St. Paul’s, the conflicting
and exciting associations of Westminster, the
marvellous feat of tunnelling under the Thames, the
enormous wealth of churches, monuments, halls, and
galleries, and carried away with him to the Continent
a very complete idea of the institutions and the queer
customs of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>From London, the party proceeded to Dover, and
from thence to Ostend and Bruges. They travelled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the cheapest manner, walking wherever practicable, and
going from Bruges to Ghent in a canal-boat, thence by
railroad across the border to Aix-la-Chapelle. Here
was another treat. The description which he gave in
his letters of his visit to the old Cathedral, where rest
the remains of Charlemagne, was one of the most
vivid recitals to be found in the annals of travel. For
some reason, he so abridged it in his book, as to take
away the finest and most original delineations. Every
reader of his first narration, who may never have
visited Aix-la-Chapelle, can in imagination see the old
Cathedral, with its shrines, its antique windows, and
the shadows of saints on the floor, and hear the sweet
undulations of the organ’s solemn peal. While to the
traveller who follows him through those aisles, and
under those magnificent arches, his words give life and
language to the pillars, altars, and luminous decorations.
To the least poetic or sentimental of travellers,
it is a solemn place; and if so to them, how deep and
impressive must it have been to a soul so full of emotion
as that of Bayard! There he wrote his well-known
poem, “The Tomb of Charlemagne.”</p>

<p>This grand old pile was succeeded next day by the
great Gothic Cathedral, at Cologne, which was not
then finished, is not now completed, and will never see
the end of the mason’s labors, because the time taken
in the construction is so long that the very stone decays,
and must be replaced at the base by the time the delicate
tracery of the towers is set on those skyward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
heights. The structure must be constantly in process
of reconstruction, from the bottom, upwards. When
Bayard looked upon this wonderful building, which
since 1248 had been in an uncompleted state, two
hundred and fifty years having been spent in active
labor, he said it impressed him most deeply, by way of
comparison. Two hundred and forty years before
America was discovered, the foundations of that
church were laid, and here they are working on it
still! By such lessons is an American made to know
his place in the history of the world. Had the history
of these old lands been less barbarous and cruel,
we should feel humble indeed. But in view of what
the old folks have done, we may be thankful that we
are young, and have our record yet to write. But the
fact that we are not so old, so great, so artistic, or so
cultured as we have flattered ourselves, is wholesome
information, and as taught by these old Cathedrals of
Europe, is very necessary to the success of our young
men. How deeply these things moved Bayard, is seen
by the very frequent mention we find in his writings,
of aisle, or arch, or dome, or spire.</p>

<p>But one of the most attractive spots to that young
voyager, in all his wanderings in Europe, he saw while
going up the Rhine, from Cologne to Mayence. He
viewed with satisfaction the vineyards and villages
along the banks; he was charmed with the crags and
crumbling towers of the innumerable old castles which
ornament the tops of all the most prominent hills and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mountains. The walled cities, the legendary caves
and grottos, the most exquisite fables that account for
the miraculous construction of cliff, and convent, and
crusaders’ halls, all came upon him as he glided by
them on the muddy river, as dreams come to the
drinker of hashish. But beyond all these in interest
to our young wanderer, was the little walled town of
Boppart, whose feudal history is nearly lost, but whose
romantic connection with Longfellow’s “Hyperion,” has
given it a fresh lease of life. Bayard there recalled
his life at home, and his days of anxious waiting;
for, had not this same “Hyperion,” with entrancing
interest, spurred on his hope to one day travel along
the Rhine? Had not this same “Hyperion” given the
impulse that started his cousin on such a great journey
to the university at Heidelberg? And were not those
houses in the town of Boppart, and was not that
cottage the very Inn of the “Star,” and might not that
woman, near the shore, be “Paul Flemming’s” boatwoman?
Oh! grand and revered Longfellow! when
we note how many a life, like these, has turned upon
the reading of your inspired words, one feels as if to
have seen your face and heard your voice, and to have
been beneath the same roof, was an honor greater than
kings could bestow!</p>

<p>But Boppart, Lurlei Berg, Oberwisel, Bingen,
and Geisenheim were soon left behind, and Mayence,
with its Cathedral six centuries old, its walls and fortresses,
welcomed them to its monotonous shades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>A beautiful trait of Bayard’s character comes gracefully
into view as we read his grateful acknowledgments
of the kindnesses he received. On his first
walk in his apprentice days, in Pennsylvania, having
determined to see some mountains, although he had to
walk two hundred miles to view them, he was kindly
served at a well, on the way, by a farmer’s girl, who
cheerfully drew the bucket from the well and ran for a
glass, that he, a dusty, thirsty stranger, might drink
without further fatigue; and in his later years he
records the fact in his book, with the sweetest expressions
of thankfulness. So when he arrived at Frankfort,
and was kindly received and entertained by Mr.
Richard S. Willis, the American consul, brother of
Bayard’s old friend, Nathaniel P. Willis, he sits down at
once, and in his letters to his friends, and in his public
correspondence, he speaks of the generosity and
thoughtfulness of his old friend, and the hospitable and
cultured characteristics of his new friend. They were
noble friends, who made for him a home at their fireside
in Frankfort, and deserve the thanks of every admirer
of Bayard Taylor. His thanks they had throughout a
long life, and not only thanks, but grateful deeds.</p>

<p>It was Bayard’s purpose to go to Heidelberg, with
his cousin, and give himself to close study, at the
University, or with private tutors; but just how he
was going to obtain the means to pay his expenses was
something of an enigma. It may be that his good
fortune in the outset made him too confident and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
careless in regard to other undertakings. At all
events, his stay in Heidelberg was much shorter than
he had at first intended that it should be, and his studies
were much more broken and superficial than his letters
show he thought they would be. He was not constituted
for close, hard, metaphysical study, and made
but little attempts in that direction, after he arrived at
Heidelberg. He loved the grand old Castle better
than the whittled benches of the University. He enjoyed
the Kaisersthul and the lesser mountains, far
more than the monotonous recital of German theories.
The river Neckar called him in its murmurs, the clouds
beckoned to him as they flew over the Heligen Berg,
the wind called for him as it sighed around the vineyards
of Ziegelhausen, and all thoughts of private,
quiet study fled at the summons. So he climbed the
mountains. It was always a passion with him to gain
an altitude as high as possible, and look out upon the
world. He tells how, when a boy, he ventured out of
a chamber window in the old farm-house at Kennett,
and seeing a row of slats which the carpenters had
used for steps in ascending the roof, he sallied forth,
and there astride of the roof, gained his first view of a
landscape. He said afterward, that the roof appeared
to be so high and the view so extensive, that he imagined
he could see Niagara Falls. Whether this
inclination to climb up came to him through the stories
of his old Swiss nurse, whose bed-time stories were of
the mighty Alps and their towering cones, or whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it was an hereditary trait in his nature, none may be
able to decide. He was certainly prone to go upwards,
and had a tendency, for horizontal motion equally as
strong. He would not remain stationary; hence, at
Heidelberg, he inspected every nook and crevice of the
picturesque old Castle, crouched through its conduits,
rapped its ponderous tun, scaled its roofless and crumbling
walls, rushed into the recesses of the adjacent
thickets, and tested the celebrated beer at the students’
resorts. He joined excursion parties which visited
the neighboring mountains, and after he had been
there a month, he knew the fields, rocks, trees, valleys,
dells, and peaks, as well as a native, and appears
to have loved them with a patriotic regard almost equal
to the eldest burgher.</p>

</div>

<p>For the purposes of this work, an outline of Bayard’s
travels is all that can be attempted; except where some
remarkable incident occurred that had an unusual influence
on his subsequent life. Leaving Heidelberg in
the latter part of October (1844), Bayard walked
through the Odenwald to Frankfort, where he could
pursue his study of the German language, and observe
the customs and characteristics of the people to better
advantage and at a less expense. In attempting to see
Europe on such a limited allowance of money, he
necessarily met with many inconveniences and privations.
His sufferings were at times most intense. He
knew what it was to fast for whole days; he felt the
pains of blistered bare feet. He was exposed to the
severest storms of summer and winter; he was familiar
with the homes of beggary and the hard, swarming
beds of third-class taverns. He must have suffered
beyond his own estimate, for, as he so well says, the
pains of travel are soon forgotten and the pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
vividly remembered. There was a youthful <em>abandon</em>
in his almost reckless adventures which startles the
reader of his tours. But yet the pains he felt so
keenly, the dangers he encountered so frequently, did
not seem to abate his enthusiasm for the great works
and beautiful scenes which Europe exhibits. To find
ourselves in a strange city, where no one speaks our
native language; where it is not possible that any
person can know us or any of our friends; without
money, or food, or work, is one of the most disheartening
situations that can be imagined. Yet such
an experience came often to Bayard. It would seem
as if, on some occasions, he ran into such difficulties
needlessly and for very wantonness. Yet, as was
sometimes the experience of the writer, and from one
of which dangerous situations Mr. Taylor generously
rescued him, there somehow opens a way out from
such ventures, which is found on the very verge of
starvation and despair. But the trait of character,
which in Bayard commanded such respect, was something
so unusual, that his daring example cannot be
safely followed by the multitude. It is far better to
have a supply of money for the necessary expenses of
travel in Europe or Asia, than to run risks for the sake
of the romance which Bayard found in such straits. To
many tourists, even the parks of Homburg, the castle
of Drachenfels, or the palace of the Vatican, would
become insignificant baubles before the stronger demands
of the body for food and raiment. But seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
did any fatigue or annoyance or loss, abate his wonderful
zeal in his search for the poetical, the strange, the
historical, and the beautiful. Some of his most exquisite
descriptions of art or nature, were written from
notes made when his stomach was empty and his limbs
chilled with wet and cold. Such young men are few;
and for one with less perseverance, endurance, or
genius to attempt such things on such a scale, would
be to meet with disheartening failure.</p>

<p>Of his life in Frankfort, during the winter of 1845,
he often speaks with great satisfaction. He made
excellent progress in the language, and in that understanding
of the habits of the people which Mr. Greeley
had so pointedly urged upon him as an ambitious
aspirant for the favors of the “Tribune.” He comes
out of that study a matured thinker. His descriptions
assume a more thoughtful tone. His sympathies are
more often awakened for the people, and he sees as a
man sees, and less juvenile are all his undertakings and
communications. He there acquired a love of German
poetry, and became acquainted with many of the noted
men of Frankfort. He visited the aged Mendelssohn,
and tells with charming simplicity how he was received
by the composer of “St. Paul” and “Elijah.” Thus
introduced to German literature, art, and music, he
entered again upon his travels at the opening of spring,
with new and increasing appreciativeness.</p>

<p>Again, on foot, he went into the untried way of
Europe. His first attraction was for the Hartz Mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
so intimately connected with Goethe’s “Faust,”
with which Bayard was already in love, and which
he afterwards translated in a masterly manner.
So he went through Friedberg and Giessen, into
Hesse-Cassel, making the acquaintance of peasants
and merchants on his way, and moralizing upon
the curious circumstance that the descendants of
the Hessians, who fought so doggedly at Brandywine,
should receive so hospitably the descendant
of those who filled the “plains of Trenton with the
short Hessian graves.” Thence by Münden, Göttingen
and Osterode, enduring sickening fatigues and dangerous
exposure, he reached the Brocken mountain, where,
through thickets, rocks, chasms, snow and cold, he at
last rested in a cottage at its summit, amid the associations
awakened by the weird tales of witches and the
superstitious explanations of that singular illusion,—the
“Spectre of the Brocken.” If he had any “wish”
on that “Walpurgis night,” which he passed on the highest
mountain of the Hartz range, it was probably to be
relieved of the tortures which his weak frame endured,
and from which the physician had failed to relieve him.
It would not be surprising if he recited from “Faust”
the words of scene IV.:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Through some familiar tone, retrieving</div>
<div class="verse">My thoughts from torment, led me on,</div>
<div class="verse">And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving</div>
<div class="verse">A faith bequeathed from childhood’s dawn,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet now I curse whate’er entices</div>
<div class="verse">And snares the soul with visions vain;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<div class="verse">With dazzling cheats and dear devices</div>
<div class="verse">Confines it in this cave of pain!</div>
<div class="verse">Cursed be, at once, the high ambition.</div>
<div class="verse">Wherewith the mind itself deludes!</div>
<div class="verse">Cursed be the glare of apparition,</div>
<div class="verse">That on the finer sense intrudes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We cannot forbear to add another quotation from
the same Act, so illustrative is it of Bayard’s note-taking
life:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No need to tell me twice to do it!</div>
<div class="verse">I think, how useful ’tis to write;</div>
<div class="verse">For what one has in black and white,</div>
<div class="verse">One carries home and then goes through it.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His visit to the Brocken was one of the most fascinating
trips of his whole pedestrian tour, notwithstanding
his narrow escape from death in the snow,
and from destruction by falling into the partially concealed
caves that beset his way to the summit. He
mentioned long afterward the view he had from the
summit-house, through the rifts in the clouds, of the
plains and cities of Germany. Thirty cities and several
hundred villages lay within sight, and all of them
more or less closely interwoven with the literature of
Germany. The plains of Brunswick and Magdeburg
stretch away for seventy miles, with all the various
shadings of green intermingled with the sparkling silver
of stream and lake. It is a scene so grand that no
pen could portray its sublimity and no tongue accurately
convey an idea of its varied beauty. With that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
romantic persistency which no amount of fatigue overcame,
Bayard descended the mountain by that rugged
and nerve-shaking path up which Faust was said to
have ascended with Mephistopheles (scene XXI. of
Taylor’s translation) who says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy,</div>
<div class="verse">The moon’s lone disk, with its belated glow,</div>
<div class="verse">And lights so dimly, that, as one advances,</div>
<div class="verse">At every step one strikes a rock or tree!</div>
<div class="verse">Let us, then, use a Jack-o’-Lantern’s glances:</div>
<div class="verse">I see one yonder, burning merrily.</div>
<div class="verse">Ho, there! my friend! I’ll levy thine attendance:</div>
<div class="verse">Why waste so vainly thy resplendence?</div>
<div class="verse">Be kind enough to light us up the steep.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After which Faust, in a musing mood, looks down
from the Brocken heights and replies:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“How strangely glimmers through the hollows</div>
<div class="verse">A dreary light, like that of dawn!</div>
<div class="verse">Its exhalation tracks and follows</div>
<div class="verse">The deepest gorges, faint and wan.</div>
<div class="verse">Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth;</div>
<div class="verse">Here burns the glow through film and haze:</div>
<div class="verse">Now like a tender thread it creepeth,</div>
<div class="verse">Now like a fountain leaps and plays.</div>
<div class="verse">Here winds away, and in a hundred</div>
<div class="verse">Divided veins the valley braids:</div>
<div class="verse">There in a corner pressed and sundered,</div>
<div class="verse">Itself detaches, spreads and fades.</div>
<div class="verse">Here gush the sparkles incandescent</div>
<div class="verse">Like scattered showers of golden sand;—</div>
<div class="verse">But, see! in all their height at present,</div>
<div class="verse">The rocky ramparts blazing stand.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>As Bayard leaped and stumbled down the rocky declivity
into the narrow gorge that there divides the
mountains to give an outlet for the river Bode, the very
difficulties bound him closer to Goethe’s writings. He
felt again how important a thing it is in literature to
connect it by patriotic links with some actual landscape,
and how much more vivid and permanent are
the lessons an author would teach when the reader
visits the mountains, plains, cities, buildings, and people
mentioned in books of classic worth. Thus learning
and growing the young traveller plodded on from
inn to inn and village to village.</p>

<p>Leipsic, which he reached a day or two after leaving
the Brocken, was a place of great interest to Bayard,
as it is in fact to all travellers. But the interest in any
city or country visited by a tourist depends so much
upon his previous reading, and the taste and opportunities
for reading are so diverse, that it seldom happens
that any two persons in the same party enjoy the same
scene with equal satisfaction. Bayard had read of
Leipsic and Dresden in his boyhood when other boys
were catching rabbits or playing ball, and as when he
sees the great citadel at Magdeburg which once held
Baron Trenck a prisoner, so when at Leipsic he looks
over the field where Blucher and Schwartzenberg met
Napoleon, he is startled with the vividness of the pictures
in his imagination. Hundreds of thousands rushing
to combat and scattering in retreat while smoke rolls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
upward from hundreds of cannon and the streams are
choked with piles of bloody dead!</p>

<p>There too was Auerbach’s Cellar, in which Goethe’s
Faust and Mephistopheles are so humorously placed.
There was the same drinking-saloon, there the descendant
of the old bar-keeper, and there the same characteristic
crowd of loafers, as when Faust and Mephistopheles
drank there, and when amid songs and jokes, the
latter drew all kinds of wine from the gimlet holes in
the leaf of the old wooden table. Bayard’s estimate of
the people appears to have confirmed that of Mephistopheles
who says (scene V.):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Before all else I bring thee hither</div>
<div class="verse">Where boon companions meet together,</div>
<div class="verse">To let thee see how smooth life runs away.</div>
<div class="verse">Here, for the folk, each day’s a holiday:</div>
<div class="verse">With little wit, and ease to suit them,</div>
<div class="verse">They whirl in narrow, circling trails,</div>
<div class="verse">Like kittens playing with their tails:</div>
<div class="verse">And if no headache persecute them,</div>
<div class="verse">So long the host may credit give,</div>
<div class="verse">They merrily and careless live.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The peasantry still crowd the cellar, still sing the
old lays, and each day tell over again the old legend of
Mephistopheles’ miraculous exit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I saw him, with these eyes, upon a wine cask riding</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the cellar door, just now.”</div>

</div>

<p>At Dresden, Bayard visited the picture-gallery, for
the purpose of seeing Raphael’s Madonna and Child,
known as the <i lang="it">Madonna di San Sisto</i>. His description
of that painting, so unfortunately abridged in his book,
was one of the finest examples of art criticism to be
found in print. His appreciation of painting and sculpture
was remarkable, indeed, for one who never made
them a professional study, and whose rude sketches
in pencil in his note books, contained nearly all of his
undertakings as an amateur. His soul seemed cast in
the proper mould for that kind of work, but his hand
was never trained to materialize the pictures that filled
the galleries of his imagination. He had all those
finer sensibilities and acute instincts which fitted him
for art in poetry or stone, and he saw in paintings and
statuary, beauties or defects which thousands of colder
but more studious critics failed to notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke of that Madonna at Dresden, as a painting
that moved his whole nature in admiration. He enjoyed
it. He feasted on it. He read it as one follows an
exciting romance. He felt the power of the picture
as Raphael felt it, and seemed to appreciate it even
more keenly than the artist. How much satisfaction
and delight he found in the enormous collections of
art in the Old World, cannot be told or understood by
any one whose natural genius leads them not in such
a direction. His mental appetite for such things grew
so keen, as he went on from city to city and gallery to
gallery, that he much preferred to leave his meals untasted, than
pass a great painting without study. Like
the true artist, his mind took in the grand ideals, and
his respect and admiration for the divine handiwork
in producing man and beast, caused him often to wince
under the suggestive and degrading obtrusiveness of
fig-leaves and rude drapery in sculpture. The human
form in all its heavenly beauty and godlike majesty,
as reproduced in marble by the great artists, was too
sacred and pure to him, to be marred by the suggestions
of sin. No man or woman will ever become an
artist, in its highest, noblest sense, until their love for
beauty, simplicity, and purity, lifts them above the
impressions that are born of ignorance, vulgarity, and
sin. Bayard, in after years, thus beautifully wrote of
sculpture:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>This appreciation of the inner feelings of the sculptor
and painter, is the more astonishing, because of the
unusual disadvantages under which he first studied the
works of the ancient masters. Aching limbs, bruised
feet, and an empty stomach are not usually aids to the
critic in forming a judgment of the symmetry or grace
of any work of art. But his enthusiastic recitals of
his visits to the celebrated paintings, show no less
rapture when he saw them in fatigue and hunger, than
when he looked upon them in rest and bodily satiety.
Thus, most naturally, he became the companion and
intimate friend of a large number of the European
artists, and was sought and highly esteemed by all
the American painters and sculptors whom he met in
Europe. He understood them. He sympathized with
their enthusiasm and sacrifices; while a great, cold
world went by them without a comforting word or a
smile of recognition.</p>

<p>Dresden was like a door to his higher art life, and
its collection of paintings is worthy of such a place.
There were, besides the Sistine Madonna, the “Ascension,”
by Raphael Mengs, the “Notte,” by Correggio,
and galleries of master-pieces by Titian, Da Vinci,
Veronese, Del Sarto, Rubens, Vandyck, Lorraine
and Teniers; with sculpture in marble, ivory, bronze
and jewels, from Michael Angelo and his cotemporaries.
Being the widest and most diversified collection
in Germany, it was eagerly sought by Bayard, and
more reluctantly left behind. More grand than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
battle of Napoleon before its gates, and more lasting
in their effects, were the historic works of art which
Dresden is so proud to possess.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DANUBE AT LINTZ.</p>
</div>

<p>From Dresden, Bayard walked to Prague, leaving
behind him, as he then thought forever, the cheerful,
hospitable, kind-hearted people, with whose kin he
afterwards became so intimately and advantageously
connected. In Prague, he ascended the heights where
the Bohemian kings and Amazon queens used to reside,
heard the solemn mass in one of Europe’s most
solemn Cathedrals, visited the bridge under which the
Saint Johannes floated with the miraculous stars about
his corpse, lost himself in the bedlam of Jewish clothing-shops,
and then, staff in hand, hastened on over
the monotonous plains, and through the highways
almost fenced with wretchedly painted shrines, to the
Paris of the west, Vienna.</p>

<p>There again were rare, treasures of art on which he
might study, and in study, increase in that dignity and
expansion of soul which only such contemplation can
give. He was delighted to hear the composer Strauss,
and his orchestra, and amusingly describes the queer
antics of that nervous little musician. He gazed with
awe at the stained banners of the Crusaders, and, with
uncovered head, listened to the grand chants in St.
Stephen’s Cathedral; but his pathetic mention of his
visit to the tomb of Beethoven is the most characteristic.</p>

<p>There was a most lovable trait in Bayard’s character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which became even more prominent in his after years
of travel, which deserves mention in this connection.
He never railed upon the dead, nor ridiculed the religious
belief or acts of devotion of any people, however
ignorant or heathenish. He often mentioned,
with emotion, the efforts of the darkened human mind
to find its Creator and Ruler. He treated with sincerest
respect every act of devotion performed in his
presence, whether by Protestant, Catholic, or Mahomedan.
There was that in his nature, and his early
Quaker education, that not only kept him in the paths
of morality and on the side of virtue, but through
all his writings there runs a thread of faith in God,
which cannot be better expressed than by quoting one
of his own sweet hymns.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In the peace of hearts at rest,</div>
<div class="verse">In the child at mother’s breast,</div>
<div class="verse">In the lives that now surround us,</div>
<div class="verse">In the deaths that sorely wound us,</div>
<div class="verse">Though we may not understand,</div>
<div class="verse">Father, we behold Thy hand!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After leaving Vienna, he went, by the way of Enns
to Lintz, which is situated in one of the most picturesque
landscapes of the Danube. The city is surrounded
by towers unconnected by walls and has a
very romantic history. Bayard in his letters speaks
of the rural scenes about Lintz in terms of the highest
admiration. It was in these Austrian landscapes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he composed that poem entitled “The Wayside Dream,”
and in which we find the following descriptive lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The deep and lordly Danube</div>
<div class="verse">Goes winding far below;</div>
<div class="verse">I see the white-walled hamlets</div>
<div class="verse">Amid his vineyards glow,</div>
<div class="verse">And southward, through the ether, shine</div>
<div class="verse">The Styrian hills of snow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O’er many a league of landscape</div>
<div class="verse">Sleeps the warm haze of noon;</div>
<div class="verse">The wooing winds come freighted</div>
<div class="verse">With messages of June,</div>
<div class="verse">And down among the corn and flowers</div>
<div class="verse">I hear the water’s tune.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The meadow-lark is singing,</div>
<div class="verse">As if it still were morn;</div>
<div class="verse">Within the dark pine-forest</div>
<div class="verse">The hunter winds his horn,</div>
<div class="verse">And the cuckoo’s shy, complaining note</div>
<div class="verse">Mocks the maidens in the corn.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Lintz, over hills and by meadows, among the
merry farmers and their light-hearted children, they
walked on, through Salzburg and Hohenlinden, to
Munich, where another magnificent display of paintings,
sculpture, palaces, parks, and historic localities,
rewarded him for his long walk and limited
supply of food. He had so little money that he
was compelled to live on twenty cents a day. There
he found the great works of Thorwaldsen, Cornelius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and Schwanthaler, and copies in marble of almost
every celebrated piece of antique sculpture. There
were the gorgeous palaces of kings and dukes, the
beautifully wrought halls and churches, with the
spacious avenues and charming parks. No city in the
world contains such rich decorations, such unique and
profuse ornamentation, or such harmony of design and
arrangement, as is shown in the palace halls and public
edifices of Munich. How a visit to them sweetens
everything else in after life, and how the memory of
them ever lightens the burden of care! What American
could walk those pavements and floors and not
yearn for the power to give to his own country something
to match those marvellous structures! Bayard
must have felt that impulse in common with others;
but, unlike many others, he kept his promise, which
was to awaken a love in every American heart for art
in its grand and stable forms; and many are the
promptings and rebukes which we, as a people, have
received from his pen as writer, and from his lips as a
lecturer.</p>

<p>From Munich, the route chosen by Bayard lay
through Augsburg, Ulm, and Wurtemberg, and when
he entered the latter country, at Esslingen, he said
the very atmosphere was permeated with poetry. He
was delighted with the green vales, lofty hills, lovely
vineyards, waving forests, and feudal ruins. He was
grateful to the kind people, and was made happy by
their universal cheerfulness and good-nature. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the home of Schiller! There the first nine years of
the poet’s life were spent, and scarce a nook is there
about the interesting old cities which that boy did not
explore. It was toward Wurtemberg, as his childhood’s
home, Schiller exhibited the greatest regard;
alas, it was there, too, in Stuttgart, that the tyrannical
Duke imprisoned him for publishing his first play.
There, too, the patriotic Uhland sat in the halls of legislation,
and wrote those poems which fired the hearts
of his countrymen to a brave defence of fatherland.</p>

<p>Bayard’s happy stay in Esslingen, and his word-pictures
of its attractions, show the progress which he
had already made in his love for that German poetry,
of which he was to become so popular an expounder.
He praises the river Neckar and its flowery banks, he
lauds the people, he portrays the landscapes in the
brightest colors which poetry may lend to prose.
Bright day! one he never recalled without exclamations
of pleasure!</p>

<p>After such interest as he exhibited in the country of
Schiller, it is no surprise, the next day after leaving
Esslingen, to find him in Stuttgart, looking up into
the pensive face of Thorwaldsen’s colossal statue of
Schiller. So attracted and entranced was he by
the interpretation of Schiller, made by the natives, the
scenery, and the old home, that when beautiful Stuttgart
opens its avenues, parks, cathedrals, palaces, and
galleries to him, he forsakes and neglects them all for
this huge but faithfully wrought counterfeit in stone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the persecuted singer. To his naturally sentimental
and sensitive character, the German poet was revealed
in ideals more fascinating than any realities. He
studied the face of his brother poet, praised his beauty,
repeated a broken stanza of “William Tell,” and left
the other attractions of Stuttgart unseen.</p>

<p>Passing the castle of Ludwigsburg, and skirting the
village of Marbach, the birthplace of Schiller, a village
then about the size of Kennett now, but obliged to
push on for fear of starvation, he walked to Betigheim,
and thence the next day to his first German home,
Heidelberg.</p>

</div>

<p>August 1, 1845, Bayard again started from Frankfort
on his pedestrian wanderings, having made up his
mind to visit Switzerland, Florence, Venice, Rome,
and perhaps Athens. On this trip his cousin Frank
was again his companion. With their knapsacks on
their shoulders and staffs in hand they began another
pilgrimage, confident and strong. With but a small
supply of money, and with but shadowy probabilities
of more, they launched out into a world to them untried
and unknown. With excited imaginations and
the keenest anticipations they rose above every difficulty
and faced boldly the probabilities of fatigue and
want. They made a short stay at Freiburg and entered
the Black Forest, passing the Titi Lake and the Feldberg
peak. Bayard’s disposition for ascending mountains,
which inclined him to see the top of everything, led
him to go up the cragged side of the Feldberg, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the summit of which he could just make out the white
crests of the Alps. On the nearer approach to them,
and when from the last ranges of the hills of the Black
Forest, they beheld the white Alps in all their indescribable
grandeur looming up at the other side of the
vast plain, Bayard spoke of the patriotic feelings which
such a sight must excite in the mind and heart of a
Swiss returning after a long absence to his native land.
He thought of his old nurse and her tales of the Alpine
scenery, and of the knolls and vales of his own home.
It is no wonder that the Swiss are free and brave and
strong. The waterfalls, cliffs, and cloud-piercing
mountains fill the soul with a sense of grandeur and
glory which tends toward great deeds and fervent
patriotism. Who can recall the eternal snows, the
towering shafts of rock, the roaring caverns, and
sweetest of blue lakes, without the most thrilling emotions!
If there are any travellers upon whom the
memory of Switzerland brings no such feelings, they
are the exceptions. Bayard’s nature was such as to
enjoy to the full, and sometimes with an intensity that
was almost pain, all those sublime exhibitions of the
power and majesty of the great Creator.</p>

<p>The fall of the Rhine near Schaffhausen hardly met
the expectations of these travellers, who had heard
their German friends speak in such strong terms of
its greatness. It is a most beautiful waterfall, and
when viewed from the platform at the base of the
cliff beneath the castle, startles the spectator with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thundering plunges and foaming whirlpools. To a
native of the same land with Niagara, the Yosemite,
and the Yellowstone, its size is insignificant. But its
beauty as a picturesque scene, when the high banks,
the long rapids, the surging pools beneath, and the
jagged rocks that rise through and above the spray
and rainbows, are included in the panorama, can be
described only in the strongest language.</p>

<p>From Schaffhausen they hurried on by the fields of
the free and happy Swiss farmers, and along highways
that reminded him of his Pennsylvania home, into the
city of Zurich. There he carefully noted the character
and customs of the people. He was cheered by
their friendly greetings, he was surprised at their intelligence,
he was pleased by the happy faces of the
children, and he was proud of the apparent influence
of a republic over its people. He visited the celebrated
poet, Freiligrath, at his villa on the shores of
the lake, where the young American poet and his elder
German brother had a most social talk of Bryant,
Longfellow, and Whittier. From Freiligrath’s exile
home, they walked by the “Devil’s Bridge” to the
Abbey of Einsiedeln, where the crowd of pilgrims and
the sweetest of singers in the church choir made a
pleasant and charming impression upon Bayard’s mind.
Thence by valleys, and mountains, so broken and
grand, and by streams so delicately blue that descended
to the placid Zug, they journeyed to Lake Lucerne.
There, on the shore, in a charming grotto, upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Righi and Pilatus look down, while above and beyond
them the white peaks of the loftier Alps shimmer
in the sunshine above the clouds, William Tell,
the father of Swiss liberty, had his home. There, in
an embowered cottage, that peeped from the leaves like
a maiden so coy, resided for a long time the poet
Goethe; and there, according to his own account, he
studied the plot for a poem, but which was afterwards
embodied by his friend Schiller in the drama of “William
Tell.” There was the rock on which Tell leaped
from Gessler’s boat; there grew the linden-tree where
Tell shot the apple from the head of his son; there the
chapel of William Tell, and there the hundreds of interesting
localities connected more or less closely with
the early tyranny of Austria and the heroic resistance
of the Swiss patriots. Bayard loved the works of
Schiller, as, in fact, could hardly be avoided by any one
who reads them in the original tongue and amid the
scenes so strikingly described.</p>

<p>From Burglen, where Tell was born and where he so
heroically died while attempting to save a child from
drowning, they marched upward along the banks of the
Reuss to Amsteg, and thence along the precipices where
the craggy mountains rose thousands of feet above
them, and, the wild stream surged and raged far, far
below them. No scene more wild and overwhelmingly
grand than that at the “Devil’s Bridge,” over
which they crossed on their way to the summit of St.
Gothard. Black chasms yawned at their feet; enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
shelving rocks hung threatening overhead.
Clouds of spray, like steam from huge caldrons, arose
from numberless pits, wherein the streams boiled and
hissed in their crevice-like channels. The clear air
was like wine. The peaks seemed to reach to heaven,
and gleamed with celestial purity. The charm of the
scenery lifted the mind and awakened the holiest emotions,
while the balm of health permeated the body,
and gave it a strength seemingly supernatural. What
person is there who loves not the dear old peaks of
Switzerland! Who has passed the heights of St. Gothard
and not awakened a glow in his body and an impulse
in his soul that strengthen him ever after!</p>

<p>But it is not our purpose to portray to the reader
the scenes, in the description of which Bayard so
much excelled, and hence, making note only of such
things as had a marked influence on his life and writings,
we hastily follow him in his pilgrimage through
the vale of Ticino, over Lago Maggiore, to the gates of
Milan, under the clear blue sky of lovely Italy. There
the most magnificent marble Cathedral in all the world,
when considered as a triumph of art in reproducing the
Beautiful, lifted its spires and figures above the roofs
of churches and palaces. A bewildering forest of
peaks and towers confuse the student of its outline,
and innumerable collections of exquisitely wrought
groups and statues dishearten and confuse the student
of art. Yet the unity of its proportions, and the
symmetry of its arches and cornices, were recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
by all. Bayard trod its artistic pavement with feelings
of awe and admiration. He gazed long upon its
aisles and pillars, and crept on tip-toe into the shadows
of its great altar. It is one of the most solemn
things in life to stand in such a temple of genius.
The stained windows, with their sacred figures and
symbols, the sweet reverberations of the sacred music,
the low chant of the priests, the kneeling forms of
penitent worshippers, the strength of the workmanship
and vastness of its sombre recesses, awaken sensations
that sleep in the open air. The naturally
vicious and cruel avoid those chancels, and the wise
and good gain encouragement from the supreme calm
that reigns therein. Bayard enjoyed his stay in Milan
and his visits to the Cathedral most heartily, and it
was an important experience in the development of
his natural character. How his skill in observation,
and his interest in everything had increased! Bright
and acute by nature, he saw and noted many things
when he first landed, which others would have passed
without observing; but those months of discipline and
anxious research had developed this characteristic,
until, as he enters Italy, he notices every shrub, every
animal, every building, every man, woman and child;
and at a glance passes them under such close scrutiny
that he is able, months after, to describe them in all the
details of form, color, nature, association, habits, and
occupation. How boundless and fathomless is the unobserved
about us! How few notice the myriad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
interesting and enlightening objects and incidents that
come within the range of their vision! The disposition
and aptitude for observation is as indispensable
to the traveller, as it is convenient to one who plods
the dull routine of home life. Bayard was naturally
discerning and inclined to investigate. Such will be
the deliberate conclusion of one who studies his life
as a whole, although his enemies have sometimes taken
advantage of his modest suppressions to accuse him of
blindness. Bayard sees a child in the garments of
priesthood, and pities him for his solitary life. He
meets a poor woman and notices the texture of her
dress, and the scar upon her cheek. He looks at a
painting of the Cathedral, and observes that a spire is
wanting. He looks at the towers, and compares those
creations of art with the more rugged spires of Monte
Rosa’s ice-crags. He laments the ignorance of the
people whose features advertised their needs. He
studies and criticises the shape and position of the
Arch of Peace, and the bronze groups that adorn its
summit: shops, toy-stands, cabs, soldiers, flowers,
priests, dukes, houses, fields, schools, coin, clothing,
atmosphere, and food,—all are noticed and laid away
for recollection, as without order they attracted his
attention. He discovered more worth relating in Milan,
than some travellers saw in the whole of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>From Milan the party walked to Genoa, going
through the battle-fields of Hannibal and the Cæsars,
along highways once the paved roads of the Roman
Empire, and under the shadows of ancient castles
whose walls once bristled with the shields of knights
and spears of yeomen. It was a glorious, though
tedious journey, and by thus travelling in the manner
of pilgrims they met the inhabitants at their usual occupations,
and learned much of the customs and feelings
of the common people. Such information comes not
through the windows of railroad carriages, nor enters
by the portals of grand hotels.</p>

<p>Having visited the ducal palaces, cathedrals, and
parks of Genoa, he went by boat to Leghorn, and
thence to Pisa. There he saw, in the Cathedral, the
swinging chandelier which led Galileo to investigate
the laws of gravitation, and satisfied his curiosity
by ascending the Leaning Tower, and left the city with
those melodies of unearthly sweetness, which the
echoes of the Baptistry give forth, still ringing in his
ears. After riding all night in a rickety cart, and suffering
horribly from the terrible storm and jolting
conveyance, he entered the sacred precincts of that
hallowed city, so beautiful, so dear to the heart of the
poet and painter,—Florence.</p>

<p>In his poem, “The Picture of St. John,” Bayard
thus speaks of that enchanted locality:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ah, lovely Florence! never city wore</div>
<div class="verse">So shining robes as I on thee bestowed:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<div class="verse">For all the rapture of my being flowed</div>
<div class="verse">Around thy beauty, filling, flooding o’er</div>
<div class="verse">The banks of Arno and the circling hills,</div>
<div class="verse">With light no wind of sunset ever spills</div>
<div class="verse">From out its saffron seas! Once, and no more,</div>
<div class="verse">Life’s voyage touches the enchanted shore.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>During his stay in Florence, Bayard wrote a poem
which so clearly expressed his affection for the maiden
in Kennett, whom he afterwards married, that many
have supposed the fictitious title, by which he addressed
her, to be her real name. In that poem he thus referred
to Florence:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dear Lillian, all I wished is won!</div>
<div class="verse">I sit beneath Italia’s sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Where olive orchards gleam and quiver</div>
<div class="verse">Along the banks of Arno’s river.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Rich is the soil with fancy’s gold;</div>
<div class="verse">The stirring memories of old</div>
<div class="verse">Rise thronging in my haunted vision,</div>
<div class="verse">And wake my spirit’s young ambition.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That Italian paradise, situated in the beautiful vale
of that most charming river, is perhaps the loveliest
spot in all that land. Being the home of such artists
as Michael Angelo and Raphael, the abode of such
poets as Dante, and of such scientific men as Galileo,
it possessed an intense interest because of its association
with them. Being also the seat of the De Medici,
of Machiavelli, of Pitti, and the resort of the greatest
American poets and sculptors, its themes for verse and
prose are almost numberless. There Bayard made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
stay of several months. He devoted himself to the
study of the Italian language, in which he soon became
proficient, and visited every castle, monastery,
amphitheatre, and mountain in the suburbs, and carefully
scrutinized the tombs of Sante Croce, the inlaid
work of the Duomo, and those marvels of art in the
Pitti and Uffizi galleries. He ever after mentioned
his first stay in Florence as a season of the most intense
delight, and knowing how vast is the field for
study and recreation, and his peculiar susceptibility to
all the lights and shades of art, we see how full was
his heart of the purest and most satisfactory intellectual
joy. There he saw Raphael’s “St. John in the Desert,”
and it is probable that the painting prompted him to
write the poem entitled “The Picture of St. John,”
the scene of which is laid partly in Florence, and is
one of his most valued literary productions. There
he saw the <i lang="it">Madonna della Sedia</i> of Raphael, the companion
piece of the <i lang="it">Madonna</i> he saw and so much
admired in Dresden. There he saw Titian’s Goddess,
so radiant with feminine beauty, and there Michael
Angelo’s first attempt at sculpture;—so many treasures
of art are there, and so many sacred places renowned
in history, that the great city gains its living from the
visitors and students that fill its hotels, and crowd its
churches and museums. Bayard actually loved Florence,
and returned to it afterwards with that irresistible
yearning which a young man feels for the home
of his lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>There remains in all the world but one other place
for the artist after he has seen and appreciated Florence.
His love for the exquisitely sweet and beautiful
is satisfied,—all the tender and delicate links between
art and nature can there be seen and felt. An exhibition
of the mighty, grand, colossal side of art
remains; and to the lover of such exhibitions, and to
the romance-seeker who, like Bayard, desires to walk
the dusty halls, peopled with the ghosts of half-forgotten
ages, Rome still waits.</p>

<p>Who has entered the aged city of Rome and not felt
the power of its thrilling associations? How the
doors of history swing open before the traveller, and
how sublime the panorama which unfolds to his view!
How swiftly pass the scenes of pomp and the parades
of heroes! It cannot be described. It must be felt
to be understood. It requires no very active imagination
to see again the strong walls, the towers, the
gates, the majestic temples, and the superb Capitol
rising over all. To be able to walk its paved
streets, and wend about its Corinthian porches, and
through its marvellous arches; to rush with the crowds
of Romans to a seat in the Coliseum; to march in
the triumphal processions, and to listen to the echo of
Cicero’s voice among the pillars of the Forum, is no
very difficult dream, when the same buildings which
saw and heard those things are yet before you. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
can stand in the shadows of ancient ruins, when the
moon gives light enough to see the outline, but not
sufficient to show the scars which the ages have given
them, and witness again the gatherings of the Roman
people, and make out the forms of Cincinnatus, of
Scipio, of Marius, of Cæsar, of Cicero, of Augustus,
or of Constantine, as their lumbering chariots jolt
over the pavements and around the palace walls. The
Tiber, which rolls on its ceaseless course, and which
saw the faces of Livy, Horace, and Virgil, moves by
the Tarpeian Rock, and the Campus Martius, with the
same eddying playfulness as it exhibited then. New
glories gild the clouds, and new temples adorn the
adjacent plains. Jupiter gives way to Jehovah, priests
of Janus and Venus stand aside for monks and friars
to fill their office. The Coliseum crumbles, as St.
Paul’s lifts its grand façades. Capitolinus falls and
St. Peter’s fills the bow of heaven. Marvels of ancient
art grow dusty with the ages, while new forms,
so divinely conceived, so incomparably wrought, and
so immaculate in modesty and matchless in color,
spring into being at the call of the later civilization.
All is interesting, exciting, glorious! One walks the
streets in dreams, lulled by the musical cadences of
the rippling native language. Words cannot convey
the feelings awakened by that new sense, which discerns
and interprets the ancient and modern associations
of Rome. The traveller feels as if he were a companion
of the great and powerful, of the refined and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
good, who have walked those streets before him, and
ever after the words they spoke, and the books they
wrote, have a fresh and unabating interest.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ARENA OF THE COLISEUM.</p>
</div>

<p>So Bayard saw the ancient city, although he has
described it somewhat differently. Rome was to
Florence what the Apollo is to the Venus de Medici,
each enhancing the beauty of the other, and losing
nothing by comparison. It was near the first of January,
1846, when the subject of these sketches entered
Rome and took up his abode in a lowly tavern opposite
the front of the Pantheon. In a most humble,
almost beggarly way, he obtained his food at the
cheapest places, and walked among those old ruins in
the most unobtrusive manner. He was too poor, and
earned too little as a newspaper correspondent, to
spend aught on the luxuries of Rome. Hence all his
time and attention were on that which pleased the
eye and satisfied the mind, rather than upon those
things which gratify the appetite or inflate the pride.
He walked to the Coliseum by moonlight, and heeded
not fatigue. For within its cragged circuit he saw
again the excited hosts, the gay ladies about the imperial
throne, the writhing Christian, and the lions
with bloody jaws. Or he saw the fiercer human beings
engaged in the gladiatorial combat, saw the flash of
shields and swords, heard the groan of the dying as it
was drowned by the rising shouts for the victor.
He searched the hidden recesses of the baths, palaces,
arches, prisons, and churches, which remain as reminders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the old city; he marched far out on the Appian
Way and contemplated its tombs and mysterious piles
in laborious detail; he sketched the spirals of Trajan’s
Column, and drew a plan of the ancient Capitol. In
awe-stricken silence he walked beneath the dome of
mighty St. Peter’s, and marvelled in worshipful mood
before those exquisite mosaics. He lingered long and
lovingly in the great labyrinth of the Vatican, wept at
the sight of some of those great paintings, and bowed
with respect to the greatest productions of the greatest
sculptors. Few will give credit to the glowing pictures
which he draws of the arts in Rome, nor believe
the strong assertions we herein make, who have not
been there and experienced the same sensations.</p>

<p>He visited in pious respect the tombs of Tasso,
Keats, and Shelley, and found his way into the studios
of the modern artists. He took short trips into the
country, and once stopped for the night under the
shadows of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli. Beyond
Rome he could not go. For once, Dame Fortune
turned her back upon him. If he would see Naples,
Pompeii, and Samos, he must have money. Money
he could not get. Grievously disappointed, yet thankful
for what he had seen, he most devoutly thanks God,
and turns northward.</p>

<p>At Civita Vecchia to which place he, as usual,
walked, he embarked, third class, on a steamboat for
Marseilles. The beds were rough planks, the food was
drenched like himself, and fleas infested every stitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
covering. It stormed, and Bayard might have perished
with exposure to the bad weather, had not a sailor
taken compassion on him and his companion, and lent
them some clothing. That kindness he ever remembered,
and it may have been in his mind when, after
meeting many sailors, he wrote of them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They do not act with a studied grace,</div>
<div class="verse">They do not speak in delicate phrase,</div>
<div class="verse">But the candor of heaven is on their face,</div>
<div class="verse">And the freedom of ocean in all their ways.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They cannot fathom the subtle cheats,</div>
<div class="verse">The lying arts that the landsmen learn:</div>
<div class="verse">Each looks in the eyes of the man he meets,</div>
<div class="verse">And whoso trusts him, he trusts in turn.</div>

<div class="verse">But whether they die on sea or shore,</div>
<div class="verse">And lie under water, or sand, or sod,</div>
<div class="verse">Christ give them the rest that he keeps in store,</div>
<div class="verse">And anchor their souls in the harbor of God!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He arrived at Marseilles with but five dollars for
the expense of a journey of five hundred miles on foot.
Dark outlook, indeed, on entering for the first time a
country with whose language he was unacquainted.
Through rain and mud, sunshine and darkness, he
moved on, courageous as ever, and enjoying with the
same zest his glimpses of ancient cathedrals and renowned
localities. At Lyons he received a small
amount of money by mail, and at a time when death by
starvation seemed but a few hours removed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
story of his mishaps by land and by water, on his way
from Lyons to Paris is a very exciting narration, as
he relates them in his “Views Afoot,” and yet shows
the best side of a most terrible experience. But Paris
was reached at last, and in the first week of February,
1846, they found a lodging place in the Rue de la
Harpe, at the rate of two dollars and eighty cents a
month. He lived on twenty cents a day, and in place
of a teacher of French, subscribed at a circulating
library and picked out the words and phrases by downright
hard study in his fireless and damp attic. For
five weeks he studied and rambled and endured privation,
learning Paris by heart and finding himself made
free and happy by the atmosphere of gayety which pervades
everything there. His favorite resort was the
Place de la Concorde, which is an open space at one
side of the palace of the Tuileries, and at the foot of
that magnificent embowered avenue called the Champs
Elysées. There were then, as now, the enchanting
groves, with the gardens, concert bowers, and shy
booths. There was the obelisk from Luxor, which
called Bayard’s attention to Egypt and created a strong
desire to see that ancient land of the Nile. There were
the solid walls of the Tuileries upon one side, the river
Seine upon another, while the twin palaces, with the
distant front of the Madeleine Church showing between
them, shut out the populous city on the other. But
the pavements, flowers, fountains, bronze figures, obelisk
and palaces were the least of the attractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which called this persevering young student to that
celebrated square. It was there that many of the most
important acts in the history of France were performed.
It was there that kings were made, and there they
were beheaded. It was there that priests had preached,
and there that they were murdered. It was there that
in the crimson and lurid days of ’94, the Red Revolutionists
each day filled the baskets at the foot of
the guillotine with the heads of twoscore and often
threescore citizens. Who would surmise that in a
city so gay, so cheerful, so imbued with the very spirit
of pleasure and childlike life, such hideous deeds of
blood and destruction could be performed! Quick-tempered,
excitable people, going with the flash of a
thought from one extreme to the other. No place in
all Paris better exhibits the character of the nation,
than the Place de la Concorde. There Bayard often
lingered and pondered, seeing clearly through the film
of gay attire, garlands of roses, delightful wines, and
gorgeous carriages, the dangerous yet often heroic
elements, which have so often thrown off the crust of
fashion and politeness, and flooded the beautiful city
with seething torrents from the deepest hell.</p>

<p class="caption">PLACE DE LA CONCORDE.</p>
</div>

<p>He sought out the master-pieces of art in the galleries,
cathedrals, and parks, and dwelt long and caressingly
upon their entrancing forms, having now passed
through a school that left him a competent critic. He
gazed after the carriage where Louis Philippe rode in
state, and wondered if such a monarchy could endure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and with a powerful yearning fumbled the unintelligible
leaves of Victor Hugo, Beranger, and Lamartine—not,
however, to be long unintelligible.</p>

<p>There, again, he was in financial distress, and was
saved from great suffering by the unexpected kindness
of a merchant, who, like Mr. Chandler and Mr. Patterson
at the beginning of his career, loaned him money,
although Bayard was a stranger and could give no
security.</p>

<p>From Paris <i lang="la">via</i> Versailles and Rouen, he walked to
Dieppe, and, after crossing the Channel, travelled by
third-class car to London, where he arrived with but
thirty cents in French money. With no money to pay
his lodging, with a letter from home in the post-office,
on which he could not pay the postage, he made desperate
attempts to obtain employment as a printer. But the
“Trade Unions” were so omnipotent, that no stranger
without a certificate could be set at work without a
“strike.” At last, when long without his usual meals, and
sure of being refused a lodging, he applied to Mr. Putnam,
who was conducting the London agency of the American
publishing firm, who loaned him five dollars, and
he could again eat and sleep. Several weeks of waiting
intervened, in which Mr. Putnam kindly kept Bayard
in employment, at a salary sufficient to pay his board,
before the money came from America to take them
home. Even then the captain of the vessel on which
he returned with his two friends who started with him
nearly two years before, was compelled to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
promise for a part of the fare. Captain Morgan, who
commanded the vessel, was one of the noblest men that
ever paced a deck, and so popular did he become, that
his biography was published thirty years after this
passage, in an illustrated number of “Scribner’s Magazine.”
Their voyage was a fair one, their landing in New
York a happy one; but no pen except his own can describe
the joy of seeing again his own country, and of
walking at evening into the door of that home which
he left two years before as <em>a boy</em>, and to which he then
returned <em>a man</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Bayard Taylor’s gifts were not such as would contribute
toward the success of a country newspaper—so
delicate, refined, poetical, and classical, we wonder
that he should ever have undertaken so uncongenial a
work. The best things which he could write would be
dull as lead to the majority of his readers. The more
literary merit his editorials and poems contained, the
less likely were they to receive the praise of his subscribers.
Yet his disposition to work was so inherent
in every nerve, that he had not been at home one week
from his tour of Europe before he was searching for a
place for editorial work or correspondence. Mr. Frederick
Foster, who was an old acquaintance and who also
had been in the office of the West Chester “Village
Record,” suggested the establishment of a weekly newspaper.
As they looked for an opening for such an enterprise,
they hit upon the town of Phœnixville, Pa., as the
most advantageous locality. Phœnixville was then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
prosperous village, containing about two thousand inhabitants,
twenty-seven miles from Philadelphia and
thirty-one miles from Reading. There were rolling-mills,
furnaces, and a variety of manufactories in the
town, and the people constituted an enterprising and
unusually vigorous community. There Mr. Taylor and
Mr. Foster began the publication of the “Pioneer,”
and with high hopes and an alarming confidence,
waited neither for capital nor subscribers.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor has often related to his friends some
most amusing anecdotes connected with his life as a
country editor. One subscriber wanted a glossary,
another wished to see the local gossip about John
Henry Smith’s surprise party, instead of the dull
columns of literary reviews. One suggested that two
editors would kill any paper, while another ventured
to assert that he himself would edit the paper for them
at three hundred dollars a year and “find shears.”</p>

<p>It was a difficult task. To edit the New York “Herald”
would have been far easier and better suited to Mr.
Taylor’s genius. The people, of Phœnixville, however,
began to appreciate their privileges after the
lack of support compelled the young journalists to close
their office and suspend the publication of the paper;
and financial aid to re-establish the “Pioneer” was
generously offered. But one year in such an unappreciated
labor was enough for Mr. Taylor, and he left
Phœnixville, according to his own account, considerably
wiser and poorer than he was when he entered it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
any of our readers has attempted to start a literary
paper in the country, and passed through the perplexities
of financial management and rude discouragements,
he will need no words to prompt his most hearty sympathy
with the work, and the suspension of Mr. Taylor’s
undertaking. To make successful a publication
of that character in a scattered and small community,
requires a greater diversity of talent, greater manual
labor, and a closer study of all-various human nature,
than it does to conduct the largest establishments in
the limitless field of a great city. Mr. Taylor’s experience
simply added another illustration of the universal
rule. His best articles were unappreciated or believed
to be borrowed, and everything hindered the
pursuit of that conscientious literary aspiration which
feels keenly the failings and improprieties of superficial
work.</p>

<p>It was in this year that Mr. Taylor prepared, and
Mr. Putnam published, his surprisingly attractive
volume, entitled “Views Afoot.” With such Quaker-like
simplicity was it written, and such a noble
spirit of poetry pervaded the descriptions of scenery,
men, and art, that it leaped into popular favor on the
prestige of its advance sheets. Its success was a
forcible example of the winning power of simple
truth. Its interest will never abate, because he did
not assume the pompous airs of an infallible critic, but
rather chose to pretend to nothing but describe what
he saw as it appeared to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The success of that book introduced him at once
into the literary circles of New York, where, with the
friendship of Mr. Willis, Mr. Parke Godwin, Mr.
Horace Greeley, Mr. William Cullen Bryant, and
many others, well known as men of the highest culture,
he received a most cordial welcome. He was
at once secured by the management of the “Literary
World,” a periodical issued weekly in New York, and
which, from 1847 to 1853, held the highest place in
literary criticism and classical composition gained by
any American magazine or paper of that period.</p>

<p>When he sought employment on the New York
“Tribune,” in 1848, a place was readily found for him,
and he began, by the contribution of small articles,
his long and honorable career as one of the editors
of that influential journal.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1849, Mr. Greeley suggested to
Mr. Taylor the importance of having some trustworthy
information from the gold regions of California, about
which there was then so much excitement. The people
read, with the greatest avidity, every scrap of news
or gossip from the gold-fields, and thousands were on
their way by steam and by overland mule-trains to
seek their fortunes in that Eldorado. At no period
of our nation’s history, not excepting the agitation at
the beginning of great wars, have the people of this
country exhibited such uncontrollable excitement as
they displayed at that time.</p>

<p>The rich sold their property to the first bidder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
took the first conveyance; while the poor started on
foot, with nothing to preserve them from the starvation
which followed in the desert. For a time it appeared
as if New England and the Middle States would be
left without sufficient male population to carry on the
routine of official duty.</p>

<p>In the height of that feverish exodus Mr. Taylor
decided to fall in with the tide, and drifting with the
current, tell the readers of the “Tribune” what he saw
and heard. Hence, in June, he took passage on a
crowded steamer for Panama, and after a dreadful
experience in crossing the Isthmus, steamed up the
Pacific Coast and entered the Golden Gate.</p>

</div>

<p>The circumstances under which Mr. Taylor entered
California, were in striking contrast with those which
surrounded him when he made his first attempt to see
the world. For, when he started for his European
tour, and throughout the whole period of his stay there,
he was hindered and annoyed by the lack of money,
and by the lack of acquaintances. Then, he was
dependent wholly upon his own earnings and economy
for every privilege he enjoyed. He had nothing
substantial behind him, and nothing certain before
him. But in California he moves among the people
with the prestige and capital of a powerful journal
behind him, and before him the certainty of ample
remuneration for all his trials. He is no longer the
unknown, uncared-for stripling, whose adventures are
regarded as visionary, and whose company was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
intrusion. He was the welcomed guest of naval officers,
of army officers, and invited to the home of
the Military Governor, and to the headquarters of
Gen. John C. Fremont.</p>

<p>When he entered San Francisco, that place was
only a miners’ camp, composed of tents, barracks,
piles of merchandise, and tethered mules. How
utterly incomprehensible it seems now to the visitor
to that great metropolis, when he reads that, as late
as 1849, there were only huts and tents where now
stand the palatial business blocks, gorgeous hotels,
and miles of residences made of brick and stone! It
was an interesting time to visit the Pacific shore, and
most interestingly did Mr. Taylor describe it in his
letters, and in his book entitled “Eldorado.” The great
camp of San Francisco was but a few weeks old when
he arrived there; but, in its boiling humanity, Mr.
Taylor noticed Malays, Chinamen, Mexicans, Germans,
Englishmen, Yankees, Indians, Japanese,
Chilians, Hawaiians, and Kanakas, rushing, shouting,
gesticulating, like madmen. Gold! Gold! Gold!
Everything, anything for gold! Though hundreds
lay in the swamps of Panama, dead or dying with
the cholera; although the bleaching bones of many
enthusiasts gleamed in the sun on the great American
desert; although thousands had perished in the
thickets, snows, and floods of the Sierra Nevada,
their eyes never to be gratified with the sight of gold-dust;
yet the increasing multitude followed faster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and more recklessly in their footsteps. Into such a
mass of half-insane humanity, did Mr. Taylor thrust
himself, that the world, as well as himself, might
profit thereby. Great names were given to the
smallest things, and prices larger than the names.
The Parker House was a board shanty with lodging-rooms
at twenty-five dollars a week, and was
not more than seventy feet square, but rented to the
landlord for one hundred and ten thousand dollars a
year. Newspapers sold for a dollar each, and nearly
every class of merchandise from the Eastern States
brought a profit of several thousand per cent. The
wages of a common laborer were from fifteen dollars to
twenty dollars a day, while real estate went up so fast
in price, that few dared to sell, lest the next day
should show that they had lost a fortune. One man,
who died insolvent, but having, in his name a small
tract of land, left after all a million of dollars to his
heirs, so much did the lands increase in value before
the estate was settled.</p>

<p>Fortunes were made in a single day. If a man
arrived there with anything to sell, he could put his
own price upon it, and dispose of it to the first
comer. One man, whose store was a log-cabin with
a canvas roof, made five hundred thousand dollars in
eight months. Gambling was carried on in an equally
magnificent scale. Greater bets than Baden-Baden or
Monaco ever saw, were common-place there. Millions
of dollars changed hands every day. Gold was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
plentiful, that boys made immense profits, gathering,
out of the dust in the streets, the nuggets and fine
gold which had been carelessly allowed to drop from
the miners’ bags or pockets.</p>

<p>From that strangest of all strange medleys, Mr.
Taylor travelled, mule-back, through a wild and dangerous
region, to Stockton, and thence to the productive
“diggings” on Mokelumne River. There he
saw the miners hard at work gathering the gold in
the most primitive manner. The sands found in the
dry bed of the river were mixed with gold, while in
the crevices and little holes in the rocks, pieces of
gold, varying from the size of a five-cent piece to that
of a hen’s egg, were frequently found. Gold from
the sand was gathered by shaking a bowlful of it
until the heaviest particles fell through to the bottom;
and by washing away the finer particles of dirt, and
picking out the stones with the fingers. Nearly every
miner found some gold; but those who made the
immense fortunes were quite rare. For many of such
as were in luck, and who found great sums, were so
sure of finding more, that they squandered what they
had discovered, in a manner most unfortunate for
them, but very fortunate for those who had found
nothing. All the details, experiences, and adventures
of these followers of Mammon were exhibited to Mr.
Taylor, and the most tempting offers made to him to
dig for himself. But, true to his employers, he
turned from mines “with millions in them,” and wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
letters for the “Tribune.” Over jagged mountains,
through thickets of thorns, through muddy rivers,
over desert plains, and along routes, dangerous alike
from man and beast, he fearlessly pursued his journey
of observation, exhibiting many of those characteristics
which have distinguished H. M. Stanley, that
other great correspondent. Sights he saw that curdled
the blood; men he met, pale, haggard, and dying;
bones he saw of lost and starved miners; and the
extremes of misery and joy, wealth and poverty,
generosity and meanness, faith in God, and worship
of the devil, which must have bewildered him.</p>

<p>The fact that he had money and social influence did
not protect him from the hardships common to all travellers
who visited the gold mines of California at that
early period. Many nights he slept in the open air,
having his single blanket and the cold earth for a bed.
Often he made his couch on a table or the floor in some
rude and dirty cabin. Sometimes he was lost in the
woods or among the mountains, and frequently suffered
long for food and water. He was determined to see
the land and its freight of human life in its most practical
form, although by so doing he often risked the
loss of comfort, of property, and occasionally of his
life.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting chapters of history to be
found in any work connected with life in the United
States, is to be found in his simple but graphic account
of the first election in California. The rough, disintegrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and shifting communities of that new land
had for a year and a half depended for law and order
upon the innate respect for the rights of others to be
found in the hearts of a majority of civilized men.
Beyond this there were organized in some of the mining
towns a vigilance committee, and in a few others a
judge with almost supreme power was elected by a
vote of the people. These officials administered justice
by common consent, having no commission or authority
from the National Government. The enormous
crowds of immigrants which filled towns and cities in
a single month made the necessity for some form of
State or Territorial government apparent to the least
thoughtful. So a few of the more enterprising individuals,
advised and assisted by the military authorities,
undertook to bring order out of chaos by calling upon
the people to elect delegates to a Constitutional Convention.
The readiness and systematic manner in which
the people of that whole region responded to the call,
was one of the most remarkable as well as one of the
most instructive popular movements to be found in
the annals of freedom. The meeting of that Constitutional
Convention at Monterey; the rude accommodations,
the ability of the body, the harmony of their deliberations,
and the wisdom of their regulations and
provisions, was the subject of many most enthusiastic
epistles from the pen of Mr. Taylor. In his celebrated
book, now so much prized by the people of California,
and by students of American history, he gives many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
little details and incidents which are left out of other
books and so often overlooked by authors and correspondents,
but which are of inestimable importance in
gaining an accurate knowledge of the inside social and
political beginnings of that powerful State. He described
the appearance of the building in which the
Convention met, gives sketches of the prominent actors
in the assembly, and, as if foreseeing how posterity
would like to preserve the memory of that great day,
he gives the complexion, color of the hair, stature, and
dress of the noted men who held seats. It is as exciting
as one of Scott’s novels to read of the emotion,
the tears, among those legislators when the new State
was born, and when the “thirty-first” gun was fired
from the fort to announce the completion of the great
event. Thus, from the consent of the governed in its
most literal sense, the officers of the State of California
derived their just powers. And without discord, rebellious
or seditious conspiracies, a new government
took its place among the empires of the world. The
description of that event in his simple, straightforward
way was one of Mr. Taylor’s best deeds.</p>

<p>Yet every incident and scene had its poetic side to
him, and, while that phase of his nature did not lead
him to exaggeration in prose, it often led him to break
into independent poetic effusions. He appears to
have long looked upon the Pacific coast as a field of
poetry and song, for, before he had any idea of visiting
the country, he wrote several poems, and located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
them there. “The Fight of Paso del Mar” was one
of those early poems, and the scene was the cliff at
the entrance to the harbor at Santa Barbara.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Most sweetly sang he of the climate, and the prolific
gifts of nature in California, and one verse of his
“Manuela” contains a very vivid and accurate picture
of some of California, as seen by many travellers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>He portrayed his California experiences in rhyme,
when he sang of “The Summer Camp,” and we quote
a few lines of it, so appropriate to his departure from
San Francisco.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No more of travel, where the flaming sword</div>

<div class="verse">Of cañons grown with pine, and folded deep</div>
<div class="verse">In golden mountain-sides; of airy sweeps</div>
<div class="verse">Of mighty landscape, lying all alone</div>
<div class="verse">Like some deserted world.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He mentioned the deep impression of ceaseless
progress which the change of a few weeks had made
in the growth of San Francisco. When he re-entered
it, after his short stay in the mountains, he could not
recognize the streets, while the inhabitants and their
manners had undergone a change still more astonishing.
Where there were tents a few days before, now
were large buildings of wood, while the log-cabins and
Chinese houses had, in many places, given place to
structures of brick and stone. Wharves had been
built, streets regularly laid out, banks opened, wholesale
stores established, lines of steamers running to
the various ports along the coast, and up the rivers;
while the rude, dirty, careless, rushing multitude
had assumed a cleanliness and a gravity, unequal of
course to that of an Eastern city, but astonishingly in
advance of the previous wildness. Law offices, brokers’
boards, smelting establishments, barber-shops, hotels,
bakeries, laundries, and news-stands had all been established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in a confusingly short space of time. The place
he found as a frontier camp, he found four months later
a swarming yet civilized city, with all the officials, and
some of the red tape which characterize older corporations.
But San Francisco was not alone in its
growth; for Sacramento, San José, Monterey, and
many other towns and cities, had been as nothing, less
than a year before. At the time he left San Francisco,
they were populous cities and villages, teeming
with a resistless, sleepless activity. To accurately
record such a change, to give an anxious public correct
information regarding that wonderland, and the
fortune of their friends, and to bear a share in the
work of establishing such a State, was the task of
Mr. Taylor, and most creditably did he perform his
part.</p>

<p>On leaving California, about the first of January,
1850, he decided to go down the coast to Mazatlan
and thence overland through Mexico. He came to that
conclusion after long consultations with his friends,
none of whom could or dared accompany him, while
all told him of robbers, deserts, impassable streams,
and dangerous wild beasts which awaited all travellers
in that benighted and trackless country. Mr. Taylor
would have enjoyed some thrilling adventures; and
the fears of his advisers only made him more decided
in his determination to go. So, alone, and with but
slight knowledge of the Spanish language, he disembarked
at Mazatlan on the Mexican coast, near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mouth of the Gulf of California, and with a pair of
pistols and a dwarfed mule, started into the unknown
wilds of that tropical land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CASTLE OF CHAPULTEPEC.</p>
</div>

<p>His hardships were many, and his fatigue at times
almost unbearable; but his love for things new and
strange, for the unexplored and unknown, kept him
moving perseveringly on through the thickets and ravines
of upper Mexico. By great skill and considerable
assurance he managed to keep in the good graces
of the people he met, and for several days, in the forests
and in the villages, he met, with very kind and hospitable
treatment.</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, he fell among thieves.
Before he arrived at the city of Mexico, and while still
in the wilderness of the interior of the Mexican highlands,
he was suddenly attacked by three Mexican robbers,
to whose marauding purposes he could make no
resistance, he having placed such reliance upon the
good faith of the natives as to carry his pistol without
a cartridge in it. The banditti made him dismount and
hand over what little money in coin he happened to
have, and after taking such blankets and trinkets as
they desired, left him with his hands tied behind him,
to get on as best he could. Fortunately they did not
want his horse, which he had bought in place of the
useless mule, and after extricating himself from his
bonds by long struggles, he mounted his horse and
rode on to Mexico with his drafts for money all intact.
He seems to have placed less reliance on the Mexicans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
after that encounter, and took good care to ride out of
range of their muskets and to keep himself supplied
with ammunition.</p>

<p>His visit to the Mexican capital was an occasion of
great interest to him, and brought up freshly and vividly
the story which Prescott has so well told of the
Aztecs and the heroic age of Cortez. No scene in Europe
is said to combine such extremes of sweetness and
grandeur, of light and shade, of valley and hill, of plain
and cragged highland, of land and water, of art and
nature, as the valley of Mexico. There he saw the
evidences of prehistoric civilization, and looked with
curiosity and awe upon the towering fortress of Chapultepec,
which connects the present with the ages
past. However, Mr. Taylor could not stop long in
that charming vale, and hastened on over the battle-fields
of Scott to Vera Cruz. From Vera Cruz he
went by steamer to Mobile, from thence overland to
Charleston, S. C., and by way of North Carolina,
Virginia, and Washington, to New York, where,
about the middle of March, he resumed his duties as
editor of the “Tribune” with the thought that there
he might stay the remainder of his life.</p>

Fidelity.—Poems Inspired by Affection.—Her Failing Health.—Consumption.—His
Return to Her.—The Marriage at the
Death-bed.—Her Death.—The Poet’s Grief.—His Inner Life.—The

</div>

<p>We now enter upon the most holy ground ever
trod by the biographer,—the sacred recesses of the
human heart. In the annals of ordinary life, or even
in those of many great men, the record of their
early love may not be important to the reader. But
to the poet, these more subtle and more tender emotions
are events of the greatest importance. Every
heart contains more or less of the poetical sentiment,
and the love and marriage of any individual is a
matter of great moment to him, although it may not
be to his biographer. But here we write of a poet.
To him, all the strings of human feeling had a clear
and unmistakable sound. To him, the undertones of
life played an important part in the harmony of his
being. All that was pure and sweet in love he saw.
All that was beautiful and lovable in life he felt, with
a keenness none but the poet can know. Hence to
him, we find, as in the history of the grand poets of
ancient days, his love was a holy sentiment, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
valued as God’s best gift, and to be worshipped as a
part of Him.</p>

<p>In a neighboring farm-house, but a short distance
from his father’s farm, lived Mary S. Agnew. She was
born and reared in the same community, went to the
same school, attended the same church, and was a
playmate, classmate, and trusted companion. They
sought each other in childhood’s days, and their
friendship ripened into love as imperceptibly and
surely as the coming and going of the years developed
their lives, and pressed them forward into manhood and
womanhood. Her dark hair and eyes, her slender
form, her lovable disposition, her conscientiousness and
purity were presented to him in that strong light,
under which all lovers see the merits and virtues of
their sweethearts. Added to that was the romance
and insight of that other sense which poets are said to
possess. He built a shrine to this idol wherever he
went, and through all his early years she was, as he
said in verse, the representative to him of the goodness
of God. On the farm, he made verses in her
honor; at the Quaker meeting he was thankful for her;
at the parties and social gatherings among the young
folks, she was the centre of his thought. Not foolishly
or blindly did he exhibit his affection. Not
extravagantly or obtrusively did he follow his wooing.
But his poetry and his prose give here and there a clew to
the deep and fervent love of his youthful days. Some
of his very sweetest poetry found its inspiration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that love, and when the volume is published, if ever
it is, in which shall appear those sonnets, which
have modestly been kept thus far from the public
gaze, there will be found gems that the world cannot
well spare. How sincere, disinterested, and noble
was his affection, was proved by his faithful and
unabated love, after he had seen the world and its
loveliest ladies, and after the cruel hand of disease had
chiselled away the round and rosy cheeks, and left, in
place of the sparkling, blushing maiden of his early
love, a pallid spectre—a shadow of her former self.
In all his wanderings, he never neglected her. In all
his most tender writings, her image is more or less
clear. In one of his volumes, “The Poet’s Journal,”
he gives a history of his love and sorrow; of the
awakening, after years of death, in the sweetest and
most touching of all his poems.</p>

<p>He allowed some of his earlier verses to see the
light of print, wherein he makes mention, indirectly,
of Mary S. Agnew. When travelling along the Danube,
in 1845, he thus writes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Old playmates! bid me welcome</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Amid your brother-band;</div>
<div class="verse">Give me the old affection,—</div>

<div class="verse">I seek no more the realms of old,—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Here is my Fatherland.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">For the sweetest music in my heart</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was the olden songs of home.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When in Florence, in 1846, he wrote a poem
entitled “In Italy,” wherein were the following expressive
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rich is the soil with Fancy’s gold;</div>
<div class="verse">The stirring memories of old</div>
<div class="verse">Rise thronging in my haunted vision,</div>
<div class="verse">And wake my spirit’s young ambition.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But as the radiant sunsets close</div>
<div class="verse">Above Val d’Arno’s bowers of rose,</div>
<div class="verse">My soul forgets the olden glory,</div>
<div class="verse">And deems our love a dearer story.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thy words, in Memory’s ear, outchime</div>
<div class="verse">The music of the Tuscan rhyme;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou standest here—the gentle-hearted—</div>
<div class="verse">Amid the shades of bards departed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I see before thee fade away</div>
<div class="verse">Their garlands of immortal bay,</div>
<div class="verse">And turn from Petrarch’s passion-glances</div>
<div class="verse">To my own dearer heart-romances.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A single thought of thee effaced</div>
<div class="verse">The fair Italian dream I chased;</div>
<div class="verse">For the true clime of song and sun</div>
<div class="verse">Lies in the heart which mine hath won.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>When he reached London in 1846, after his long
pilgrimage, and when so reduced in funds and friends,
he yet had the time and mind to write of her these
graceful rhymes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I’ve wandered through the golden lands</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Where art and beauty blended shine—</div>
<div class="verse">Where features limned by painters’ hands</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Beam from the canvas made divine,</div>
<div class="verse">And many a god in marble stands,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With soul in every breathing line;</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yet brighter than those radiant dreams</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which won renown that never dies—</div>
<div class="verse">Where more than mortal beauty beams</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In sybil’s lips, and angel’s eyes—</div>
<div class="verse">One image, like the moonlight, seems</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Between them and my heart to rise,</div>
<div class="verse">And in its brighter, dearer ray,</div>
<div class="verse">The stars of Genius fade away.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is an interesting study and one not altogether
unprofitable, to follow, through an author’s works the
marks of his peculiar likes, joys, and sorrows. For
in science, philosophy, history or poetry, the feelings
of the student will unguardedly creep into his manuscripts
as if between the lines, and often a little
word, or a thoughtlessly inserted sentence or comment,
will reveal whole chapters of a life which has been
carefully, scrupulously hidden. So in Bayard Taylor’s
poetry, written on sea and on land, at home and
abroad, in poverty and in affluence, there is a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
vein of originality, and certain references to his own
life, which, when placed together, give the clew to his
inner life, and reveal a charming domestic scene, which
cannot be described in prose. One of his characters
in “The Poet’s Journal,” says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Dear Friend, one volume of your life I read</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Beneath these vines: you placed it in my hand</div>
<div class="verse">And made it mine,—but how the tale has sped</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Since then, I know not, or can understand</div>
<div class="verse">From this fair ending only. Let me see</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The intervening chapters, dark and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">In order, as you lived them.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To which another makes reply in the words below,
which so delicately and feelingly refer to his early
love, his sorrow at the death of Mary, his first wife,
and the brightness of the later affection. To one who
has passed through the same trying experience, these
lines are marvellously expressive:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What haps I met, what struggles, what success</div>
<div class="verse">Of fame, or gold, or place, concerns you less,</div>
<div class="verse">Dear friend, than how I lost that sorest load</div>
<div class="verse">I started with, and came to dwell at last</div>
<div class="verse">In the House Beautiful.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You, who would write ‘<i lang="la">Resurgam</i>’ o’er my dead,</div>
<div class="verse">The resurrection of my heart shall know.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For pain, that only lives in memory,</div>
<div class="verse">Like battle-scars, it is no pain to show.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then he goes on to recite a tale so like his own, that
it needs scarce any change, but to substitute the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of himself, and those he loved, for the fictitious names
we find in the poems. But, before making further
quotation, the reader should be made acquainted with
the circumstances which prompted those illuminated
lines.</p>

<p>While Mr. Taylor was away, Miss Agnew gradually
and surely declined in health, until consumption,
with all its terrible certainty and serpent-like stealth,
made her its victim. It was one of those unaccountable
visitations which sometimes come to the young and
beautiful in the midst of joy and perfect content. How
sadly the news of her sickness fell upon the heart of
her lover, and how tenderly and anxiously he prayed
and waited for letters from her, which should contain
better tidings, he has himself related. Pale and weak,
she greeted him on his return from California, with the
prediction that she could not live beyond the falling
leaves. No skill, no tender nursing, no charm of an
abiding love, could stay the hand of death, which, as
unseen and secret as the decay in a rose, gradually
stole away her color, her beauty, and her life.</p>

<p>He felt that he must lose her; and the whole world,
which had before appeared so bright, became dark and
chilly. The test showed that while his ambition led
him to see the great nations of the earth, to write
poems for posterity, and to write his name in italics
on the scrolls of fame, there was one solace, one comfort,
one desire, which included all the others and made
them subservient. He was true to his plighted word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
He had become noted and prosperous, while she had
remained at the country farm-house in Kennett. He
was the associate of Bryant, Greeley, Webster, and
Willis; she, the companion of the farmers and Quakers
of Chester County. But strong, manly, and honest,
his love knew no abatement and his respect felt no
check.</p>

<p>It is a touching picture—that simple, solemn marriage
in the room of the patient, an almost helpless invalid!
He came to redeem his pledge; and in that
simple abode, with death standing just outside the
door, with a bride scarce able to whisper that she took
him for her lawful spouse, he became a husband.
The dim, appealing eyes, the tender little flush in her
cheek, the tremor of her thin hand, told the joy in her
pure heart, but showed also that her happiness would
be as brief as it was sincere.</p>

<p>The marriage took place Oct. 24th, 1850, and on the
21st of the following December his wife died. She
lingered much longer than her friends expected. At
the marriage it was said that she could not live but a
very few days. Yet, so soon was it after their union,
that the day which is usually the happiest and the day
which is usually the gloomiest in a man’s life, came
to him within ten weeks of each other. A year after
her death, he wrote a poem, “Winter Solstice,” in
which he mentions his bereavement:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“—For when the gray autumnal gale</div>
<div class="verse">Came to despoil the dying year,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Passed with the slow retreating sun,</div>
<div class="verse">As day by day some beams depart,</div>
<div class="verse">The beauty and the life of one,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose love made Summer in my heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Day after day, the latest flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Her faded being waned away,</div>
<div class="verse">More pale and dim with every hour,—</div>
<div class="verse">And ceased upon the darkest day!</div>
<div class="verse">The warmth and glow that with her died</div>
<div class="verse">No light of coming suns shall bring;</div>
<div class="verse">The heart its wintry gloom may hide,</div>
<div class="verse">But cannot feel a second Spring.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O darkest day of all the year!</div>
<div class="verse">In vain thou com’st with balmy skies,</div>
<div class="verse">For, blotting out their azure sphere,</div>
<div class="verse">The phantoms of my Fate arise:</div>
<div class="verse">A blighted life, whose shattered plan</div>
<div class="verse">No after fortune can restore;</div>
<div class="verse">The perfect lot, designed for Man,</div>
<div class="verse">That should be mine, but is no more.”</div>

<p>In his “Picture of St. John” he describes, with a
feeling born of experience, a scene like the closing
one in the life of his wife.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“Day by day</div>
<div class="verse">Her cheeks grew thin, her footstep faint and slow;</div>
<div class="verse">And yet so fondly, with such hopeful play</div>
<div class="verse">Her pulses beat, they masked the coming woe.</div>
<div class="verse">Joy dwelt with her, and in her eager breath</div>
<div class="verse">His cymbals drowned the hollow drums of death;</div>
<div class="verse">Life showered its promise, surer to betray,</div>
<div class="verse">And the false Future crumbled fast away.</div>

<div class="verse">For from her face there beamed such wondrous bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">As cannot find fulfilment here, and dies.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nearer the end of the same poem, he writes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“With cold and changeless face beside her grave</div>
<div class="verse">I stood, and coldly heard the shuddering sound</div>
<div class="verse">Of coffin-echoes, smothered underground.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And still later he says, as only he can say who has felt
it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My body moved in its mechanic course</div>

<div class="verse">Or blindly stirred with undirected force,—</div>
<div class="verse">A weary trance which only Time decreased</div>
<div class="verse">By slow reductions.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A sonnet of that dark hour, written on a leaf of
his diary, remains to us, from which we quote two
verses:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane,</div>
<div class="verse">And fall, thou drear December rain!</div>
<div class="verse">Fill with your gusts the sullen day,</div>
<div class="verse">Tear the last clinging leaves away!</div>
<div class="verse">Reckless as yonder naked tree,</div>
<div class="verse">No blast of yours can trouble me.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Moan on, ye winds! and pour, thou rain!</div>
<div class="verse">Your stormy sobs and tears are vain,</div>
<div class="verse">If shed for her whose fading eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Will open soon on Paradise;</div>
<div class="verse">The eye of Heaven shall blinded be,</div>
<div class="verse">Or ere ye cease, if shed for me.”</div>

<p>Here is another sad, sad wail, to be found in his
“Autumnal Vespers”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The light is dying out o’er all the land,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And in my heart the light is dying. She,</div>

<div class="verse">From Earth, from me, and from the dreams we planned,</div>
<div class="verse">Since first Love led us with his beaming hand</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From hope to hope, yet kept his crown in store.</div>
<div class="verse">The light is dying out o’er all the land:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To me it comes no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The blossom of my heart, she shrinks away</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Stricken with deadly blight: more wan and weak</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Her love replies in blanching lip and cheek,</div>
<div class="verse">And gentler in her dear eyes, day by day.</div>
<div class="verse">God, in Thy mercy, bid the arm delay,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which thro’ her being smites to dust my own!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou gav’st the seed Thy sun and showers; why slay</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The blossoms yet unblown?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In vain,—in vain! God will not bid the Spring</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Replace with sudden green the Autumn’s gold;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And as the night-mists, gathering damp and cold,</div>
<div class="verse">Strike up the vales where water-courses sing,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">A memory and a name.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, in “The Two Visions,” was the low moan of
a poet’s stricken heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Through days of toil, through nightly fears,</div>

<div class="verse">“That vision died, in drops of woe,</div>

<div class="verse">A cold mound in the winter snow;</div>

<p>How accurately he portrayed his inner life, from
the death of Mary to his subsequent marriage, can
only be understood by reading his poem of “The
Poet’s Journal” entire. But, as far as brief quotations

<p>The great grief which Mr. Taylor felt when his wife
died, was so deep and keen that he was for many
months unreconciled, and in a mental state somewhat
akin to despair. His appearance among his friends,
whether at Kennett or in the office of the “Tribune” at
New York, did not, however, betray his feelings so
much as his private correspondence and occasional
poems. He was the sincerest of mourners; and his
natural susceptibility to every shade of emotion
made this severe bereavement an occasion of untold
suffering. In his endeavors to banish the gloomy
spectre, he resorted to hard work. Hence, the first
half of the year 1851 was one of the busiest seasons
of his life. He wrote early and late. He composed
poems and essays, wrote editorials, and edited correspondence,
some of it being the labor attached to his
profession, but a great share of it written to occupy
his mind and shut out his affliction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>His “Rhymes of Travel,” which had been published
after his return from California, called the attention of
the reading public to him as a poet, and there was a
strong demand for another volume. His friends urged
him to write, his uneasy heart pushed him into work,
and the newspapers kept questioning him about
the advent of a second volume, until he decided to
bring out his book of “Romances, Lyrics, and Songs.”
There was one poem in that volume which was very
sweet when wholly disconnected with history, but
which becomes fascinating and sad as Milton’s lament
for his eyesight, when we once know the circumstances
and the mental condition in which it was written. Two
verses of that poem were printed, as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Give me music, sad and strong,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawn from deeper founts than song;</div>

<div class="verse">Than the poet’s numbers be:</div>
<div class="verse">Music which can master thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Stern enchantress, Memory!</div>

<p>It was then that he wrote those pathetic lines, so full
of his sadness and so descriptive of his bereavement,
that he was never satisfied with a name for them and
finally left them without a title, the first couplet of
which sufficiently indicates the tenor,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane,</div>
<div class="verse">And fall, thou drear December rain!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a sorrowful heart and such an overworked
brain were too great a load for one human body to carry.
His physical strength had never been remarkable,
and there had been seasons before his visit to Europe
when his health seemed permanently impaired. So
when this great strain was made upon his system it
began to weaken. To continue the effort was suicidal,
and stoutly condemned by his relatives and friends.
He then recalled his exhilarating walks among the
Alps and on the plains of Europe. He kindled anew
his zeal for adventure. He studied the map of the
world to decide where was presented the most favorable
field for discovery. He wished for rest from
sorrow, and rest from close application to literary
work. Such a relief could only be found in a climate
and among a people wholly different from his own.
In this choice he was guided somewhat by a fortunate
opportunity to cross the Atlantic as a guest and friend,
and by the accounts which a literary companion in the
office of the “Tribune” gave of the interesting people
and scenery along the coast of Palestine and Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The winter had passed and the soothing winds of
summer seemed so grateful and necessary, that he
decided to pass the next winter on the Mediterranean,
should his health admit of the necessary outlay of
strength. In writing about that undertaking afterwards,
he said a trip into Africa would furnish good
material for a travelling correspondent and hence that
continent was selected. “But,” he said, “there were
other influences acting upon me which I did not fully
comprehend at the time, and cannot now describe
without going too deeply into matters of private
history.” But while in Central Africa, enjoying the
invigorating breezes along the Nile, he reveals a part of
that private history by an incidental exclamation published
in a letter to the “Tribune.” “Oh! what a rest
is this from the tantalizing and sorrowful suggestions
of civilization.” He fled from sorrow—driven into the
desert.</p>

<p>Having reached Smyrna, on the coast of Asia Minor,
by the overland route to Constantinople <i lang="la">via</i> Vienna,
he re-embarked at that port for Alexandria in Egypt,
arriving at the latter place Nov. 1, 1851. We shall
not attempt here to give in any satisfactory detail
the record of his wanderings in Africa, as they
are so charmingly and instructively told in the book
which he wrote concerning them, and as no book of
travel in Egypt, except a scientific work, can supplant
or equal the many which already honor our shelves.
The writer having been over a large portion of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Taylor’s routes, and feeling much indebted to him
for his works, which were often used as guides,
has perhaps a greater interest in recording his travels,
than the reader would have in going through the story
a second time. Hence, for the purposes of this outline
sketch of Mr. Taylor’s life, we shall introduce only
such incidents and facts connected with his wanderings
as appear to have some direct or unusual bearing upon
his character, or which display some peculiarity of his
genius or taste.</p>

<p>He said, in a letter to a friend in New York, that he
“owed a debt of gratitude” to the Providence which
led him, to the country which attracted him, and to the
vessel which carried him from Smyrna to Alexandria.
That sentiment was awakened in his heart by the way
in which some of the important events in his after life
pointed back to that trip and to the valuable friend he
met there. Mr. Taylor was of a genial, approachable
nature, and easily made the acquaintance of any person
whom he met. But having German blood in his veins,
loving the German language, and entertaining a sincere
respect for German literature, he naturally sought the
company of the German people. On the very threshold
of this trip into Africa he made the acquaintance of a
German gentleman, whose culture and geniality made
him a great acquisition in a strange land. They seem
to have taken a deep interest in each other from the
first time they met. It may be because their condition
in life, socially and circumstantially, was so similar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
but the more reasonable explanation is found in their
similar tastes and equal regard for the works of genius
and the beauties of nature. It will be like a romance,
when told in all its detail, as it might be now, and will
be when the present generation passes away. How little
could his human understanding comprehend the great
results turning upon the simple, common-place self-introduction
to a German travelling companion! This
friend, whom he met, and with whom he made the journey
up to the cataracts of the Nile, was perhaps as
remarkable a man as Taylor, and belonged to a family
of scholars and long respected agricultural citizens of
the German principality of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.</p>

<p>The chief merit of Mr. Taylor’s descriptions lay in
their apparent frankness and their charming details.
He appeared to think that every reader was acquainted
with the works of those great archæologists, Lepsius
and Champollion, and did not attempt to supply to
his readers the information they had already given.
He seems to have imagined that all the reading public
wished to follow him, and he gave such information as
the tourist would need. He told about the clothes he
purchased in Alexandria, about the fit of his Arab attire,
about the cost of a dinner, the conversation between
dragomen and boatmen, the personal appearance of his
companions, the faithlessness of his guide, the dirty
appearance of his boat, and the gorgeous sunset. He
described his own sensations and actions with the
boldness of one unconscious of any motive to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
or deceive. He reveals the sorrow of his heart by
occasional remarks such as these: “For many months
past I had known no mood of mind so peaceful and
grateful.”—“I am away from reminders of sorrow.”—“It
is not the beauty of the desert that gratifies me so
much, in these days, after all, as the absence of civilization.”</p>

<p>The party, which consisted of Mr. Taylor, the German
companion, and an Italian, engaged one of the
Nile boats, at Alexandria, for the trip up the Nile, and
after testing the comforts, or misery, of the Egyptian
hotels, seeing Cleopatra’s Needle (now in London)
and Pompey’s Pillar, which were then as in later years
about all that there was to be seen of interest in Alexandria,
they started on their lazy voyage up the wonderful
Nile. He wrote with great enthusiasm of the
sweet rest he found in a pipe of tobacco, after the manner
of all habitual smokers. He seems to have had
plenty of time to muse and smoke as he slowly ascended
the stream. It has often been a subject of wonder
that he could afterwards remember so many incidents
and the impressions they had made on him, when perhaps
weeks of time and some more exciting transactions
had intervened. But Mr. Taylor did not wait long before
recording his ideas and comments, and was in the
habit of keeping a memoranda-book always at hand,
and while travelling, noted with a pencil any peculiar
thought or incident which awakened attention.</p>

<p>At Atfeh, which has been for hundreds of years an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
intermediate stopping-place on the highway and river
between Alexandria and Cairo, he clambered up into
the town and witnessed a marriage procession. He
appears to have been inclined to get a near view of the
bride; but the relatives hurried her off, and with cries
and threatening gestures drove him back to cover.
But he decided that if he could not see the bride, he
would do the next best thing, and accordingly visited
her father. The disconsolate parent was being comforted
by a hoarse chant and appeared to be as cheerful
as could be expected considering the din.</p>

<p>At the town of Nadir he went into a low mud hut,
which pretended to be a cafe, and there saw the Egyptian
fandango danced by the inmates. He records the
shape and sound of the musical instruments and with
polished and concise language pictured the scene to
the reader’s eye. This, with the accounts of the improvements,
rates of toll, and the manner of passing
the boats by locks, and government officials, with many
minor details is told in a manner which, notwithstanding
the dryness of the subject, makes most fascinating
reading.</p>

<p>But he counted his entrance into Cairo, the capital
of Egypt, as the actual beginning of his tour into
Africa. For at Alexandria and along the Nile as far
as Bourak the people exhibited some traits which connect
them with the civilized West. But Cairo is
wholly Egyptian. The centuries have made no apparent
changes in the people. The donkeys, the veiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
women, the fierce Arabs, the water-skins, the fountains,
the slaves, the palms, the white domes, and the low
shops revive the historical associations and personify
the Past. Like an oasis in the adjacent desert was the
Hotel d’Europe. But it served to impress the reality
of these surroundings more forcibly upon the travellers.
With a readiness and enjoyment which his companions
did not share, he accustomed himself to the manners
and appearance of the people, and it was scarcely a
day before Mr. Taylor would smoke his perfumed chibouk,
sit cross-legged, and eat with his fingers like a
native Arab. He rode the little donkeys as well as
any citizen of Cairo, and was even more reckless than
they, if that were possible, as he rode through the market-places
at a furious speed. The Egyptians, like the
Germans, Italians, French, Hungarians, and Syrians,
felt a kind of fellowship for Mr. Taylor, and admired
his good-sense in appreciating and adopting so many
of their customs. He was the acquaintance and confidential
friend of a dozen old Arabs before he had been
two days in Cairo. He was a lover of mankind. He
sympathized with them all. As the Shereef of Mecca
rides by, Mr. Taylor admires his dignity and his imposing
retinue. As a marriage procession files through
the streets, he comments on the playing of the flutes,
the crimson robes of the bride, and the diadem, with
the simplicity of a country maiden in America. He
enjoys the athletic tricks of the showmen, the skill of
the swordsmen, the voices of the singers, the zeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the beggars, and the endurance of the laborers. He is
one of the same human family. They know it, and feel
it, and he is welcome.</p>

<p>The German acquaintance, who had not intended to
go farther than Cairo, was so delighted with Mr. Taylor’s
companionship and Mr. Taylor was so interested in
him, that he decided to go up the Nile as far as Assouan,
which was on the border of the Central African countries.
Mr. Taylor speaks with sentiments of enthusiastic
thankfulness of his good fortune in thus securing
a travelling companion, whose tastes and sentiments
were so akin to his own. He little thought then, that
while trying to shut out his sorrow by voluntary exile,
he was opening the door to a second love. Mr. Taylor’s
singular admiration and love for his companion is
almost unaccountable, unless we adopt some theory of
foreordination or providential design.</p>

<p>A most interesting, amusing, and friendly trip they
had up the stream, for thousands of years so historic,
in a boat manned by ten boatmen, and of which they
were the commanders. Neither of them had ever been
in Egypt before, but their maps and guide-books,
coupled with their early historical training, made the
localities along their route seem more familiar to them
than to the dragomen, who made it a business to guide
travellers. They named their boat the “Cleopatra,”
ran up the Stars and Stripes to the peak, and, with
contented minds but active brains, enjoyed to the full
the strange scenes and historic ruins which showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
themselves on every hand. They first visited the Pyramids,
where Mr. Taylor gratified his taste for climbing
heights, and nearly killed himself by rushing down.
With characteristic regard for those who were to
come after him, Mr. Taylor rebuked the importunities
of the backsheesh-loving Arabs about the Pyramids,
and obtaining no satisfaction from them, he reported
them to the chief, who compelled the greedy desperadoes
to submit to a severe whipping.</p>

<p>They visited ancient Memphis, which the French
explorer, Mariette, was then exhuming, and trod the
pavements over which had passed the feet of Menes,
Amasis, Pharaoh, Strabo, and Cambyses. They were
hospitably entertained by the great antiquarian, and
felt that such a visit was ample reward for all their
outlay. From Memphis they proceeded to Siout, and
on the way talked, composed, and sung the praises of
Father Nile. It may be that Mr. Taylor’s mood, which
he so often mentions, had an influence upon his taste,
or it may be that the season was one peculiarly adapted
to the exhibition of beauty in the Nile, but the writer,
in a later year, was not so charmed by the scenery and
river as Mr. Taylor appears to have been. No other
traveller has written such glowing encomiums upon the
Nile as Mr. Taylor recorded in his letters, and either
he appreciated nature more than other travellers, or
there was something in his circumstances which placed
a halo of beauty about the palms and meadows. In
the “Nilotic Drinking-Song” Mr. Taylor said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>His admiration was not spasmodic, for he always
mentioned the Nile as the most majestic of rivers. To
the majority of travellers, however, the hoary ruins of
mighty cities, the tombs of priests, and the pyramids
of kings are so much more exciting and mysterious,
that the Nile is itself of secondary importance.</p>

<p>Yet, Mr. Taylor, with all his interest in the river,
did not have less in the celebrated localities and ancient
remains. He ascended many honeycombed mountains,
to creep among the bones of men who lived thirty-five
hundred years ago. He gazed with a yearning interest
upon the broken columns of unknown temples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
dreamed of their former grandeur, while apathetically
overseeing the affairs of his little monarchy over which
he kept floating the Stars and Stripes. He became so
absorbed in the climate, the people, and the history of
the land, that he soon adopted the full costume of the
country and became henceforth an Arab with the
others. He was marvellously quick in picking up the
words and phrases of any language, and soon, with the
aid of a small phrase-book, he could readily converse
with the natives along the shore. These characteristics
made it safe and pleasant for him to travel where many
others would have found only misery and death.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Taylor’s sympathy with all mankind led him to
regard with sincere respect the daily religious ceremonies
which his Moslem boatmen performed, with their
faces toward Mecca. He often mentioned their punctuality
and apparent sincerity, and contrasted it with
some of the formal, half-hearted proceedings in some
Christian churches. His regard for conscientious worship,
which appeared to characterize the ignorant Arabs,
appears more striking to persons who have travelled
the same route over which Mr. Taylor went, for it is
so common a sight to see bigoted, conceited Europeans
ridiculing the prostrations, prayers, and gestures of
the worshippers. The writer most keenly regrets
having been compelled to witness the caricaturing of
a Moslem at prayer, by a coarse, hard-hearted, brutal
Christian countryman, while the sad and shocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
believers in Mahomet stood by, scarce able to resist the
temptation to throw the Frank into the Nile. In the
lovable, noble character of Mr. Taylor, there was no
inclination to ridicule the conscientious belief of any
man, and instinctively he kept silent and patiently
endured the delay when the call to prayer took his
employees from their labor. In return for his sincere
regard for them, he received the love and most faithful
service of the natives. They stole nothing from
him. They shielded him from enemies and affectionately
cared for his health.</p>

<p>Thus, with friends for boatmen, an admirer for
a guide, and a most agreeable comrade for a travelling
companion, he floated along, inhaling from every
breeze the essence of health and comfort. The banks
were covered with the richest and rarest verdure, for
it was the Egyptian spring. There were luxuriant
grasses, palms and sugar-cane; there flourished wheat,
cotton, maize, hemp, indigo, tobacco, oranges, olives,
and dates, springing from the richest soil which
civilized man has yet seen. Harvests came and went
in confused succession; the ripe fruit with blossom;
threshing-floors piled with ripe dourra, while around,
the new wheat seeking the sunlight, betokened
a bounty munificent and inexhaustible. So prolific
and speedy was the growth of the crops that the people
could not, with their rude implements, avail themselves
of the full benefits of one harvest before its rank
successors forced them to turn their labor into other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
channels. Then, as now, the fields, for miles inland
from the river, were checkered with canals, and the
rude water-wheel and awkward “well-sweep” were
kept in constant motion to supply the vast amount of
water necessary to the irrigation of hundreds of square
miles. There were goats, mules, horses, and a variety
of fowl, and in the wild nooks a grand collection of
birds of the gayest songs and plumage. The sky was
clear, the air balmy, the breezes cool and light, the
cabin of their boat was spacious, and their beds comfortable.
It was “a soothing experience for an aching
heart.”</p>

<p>In the first week of December they arrived at Dendera,
where stands in majestic completeness one of the
most ancient temples of Egypt. It has for thousands
of years been half buried in the earth, and at one time
must have been nearly hid by the shifting sands of the
desert which once surrounded the pile. The impression
which the gigantic columns, sixty feet high, and
the enormous blocks of stone, eight feet thick, gave to
them, is doubtless shared in some degree by all travellers.
As he walked through the shadowy recesses,
each aperture seeming like a deep cave in a rocky
mountain, he was filled with a solemn sense of awe
and sadness, which so overwhelmed him that he
peered about the avenues in silence, and involuntarily
stood on tip-toe. The sombre grandeur of the massive
masonry, the sacred associations connected with
the ancient worship of Osiris and Isis, the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
tales of wars, tyrannies, famines, plagues, Rameses,
Moses, Pharaoh, Alexander, Ptolemy, Cambyses, and
Napoleon, which those lofty statues could tell if their
symmetrical lips could speak, awaken indescribable
emotions, deep, thrilling, and permanent. Mr. Taylor
saw a grace and an artistic merit in the stone figures,
and in the hieroglyphics that adorned the temple,
which few travellers detect or admit. To many
travellers the figures on those old porches and halls
seem rude and often out of proportion, and the writer
confesses to having been one of the latter class. But
Mr. Taylor’s appreciating scrutiny may be accounted
for on the basis that with his poetical instincts and
thorough culture in art, there were beauties in those
works of ancient sculptors, latent to others, but apparent
and striking to him. But there is no disagreement
as to the unspeakable solemnity of the place and the
gloom of its lonely halls.</p>

<p>The next night they reached Luxor, and caught the
first glimpse of those interesting ruins by moonlight.
There, silent and stately, arose the great Colonnade.
There, quietly recalling the ancients, stood the twin
Obelisk to the one at which Mr. Taylor had often
looked in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, when as a
boy he dreamed of distant Egypt. For seven miles
around the Temple of Luxor are the ruins of ancient
Thebes, within which were once the temples of Karnak,
Luxor, Goorneh, Memnonium, and hundreds
more, which now cumber the otherwise fertile plains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Thebes, with its hundred gates, with its countless
armies, with its wise men, its Colossus that sang in the
morning sunlight, its avenues of sphinxes and gods in
stone, lay broken, spurned, and dead before them. The
same moon looked down on them that gazed on the priests
of Isis and the palace of its Cæsars. No one can imagine
anything so solemn and grand as to stand in the moonlight
on the haunted plains of ancient Thebes! One
may have thought the Coliseum at Rome impressive
beyond description when seen in the favorable light of
an autumn moon, but when compared with Thebes it
is tame and insignificant. Ages and ages before the
rape of the Sabines, these temples had been constructed.
They saw the morning of civilization; but now they
are ruined and useless, the night seems best fitted for
an appreciative view of them. Among the mighty
colonnades whose columns are broken and falling, and
around gigantic remains of ancient statues carved from
a mountain of stone, Mr. Taylor wandered for two
whole days. He scrutinized closely the long rows of
ancient tombs, and stood in the rocky grave of Rameses
I. The pictures on the walls of the tombs, the
kind of rock, the original shape of the temples, the
employments of the ancient races, the blue sky overhead,
the clear atmosphere around, together with
sketches of history and poetical allusions, shared in
the interesting letters which Mr. Taylor wrote from
Thebes. Such scenes contain an inspiration and an
education which make scholars and statesmen of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as love history and appreciate the lessons those ruins
teach. To one of Mr. Taylor’s disposition, a visit to
such a place was a privilege not to be lightly thrown
away. He investigated everything, and in a manner
bordering on recklessness he descended through small
holes into dark subterranean tombs, and with equal hardihood
walked the crumbling roofs and cornices of the
lofty ruins. He looked with disgust on the evidences
of spoliations which were to be seen in splintered
columns and fragments of ancient frescoes, and which
were the work of scientific explorers. He regarded
with a jealous anxiety the evidences of vandalism and
decay, and wished sincerely that time and man
would allow those precious relics of the old régime to
remain forever intact. He appears to have regarded
those massive wrecks as half-human, and sympathized
with their forsaken and friendless condition.</p>

<p>But in all this antiquarian excitement, which usually
occupies the undivided attention of less enthusiastic
travellers, Mr. Taylor neglected not the living. He
witnessed with interest the graces of the Arabian
dancing-girls, noticed the features of the beggar-boys,
the methods of teaching children the Koran, and the
worn appearance of the water-carriers.</p>

<p>Leaving Luxor, they spent three or four days ascending
the river to Assouan, and in visiting the villages,
old temples, half-buried cities, and gorgeously
decorated tombs in the mountain-sides, which are
almost numberless in the valley of Upper Egypt. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Assouan, he was most cordially received by the Governor
and was given a friendly greeting by all the
officials he met. From that town he made several
excursions with his German friend, the most interesting
of which was that to the cataract of the Nile and
the island of Philæ. There he saw the celebrated
temple of the time of the Ptolemies, which he looked
upon as modern, because it was not over twenty-two
hundred years old. But he felt sufficient interest in
the ruins of the old city to describe that marvellous
colonnade which has astonished so many visitors to the
island of Philæ. The reader of his letters can detect,
however, in Mr. Taylor’s description of columns,
aisles, roofs, walls, capitals, sculptures, monoliths,
and colossi, a vein of sadness which may have colored
his views. At all events the ruins of Philæ did not
impress him as they seem to have affected other visitors.
The fact that he was so soon to part with a
companion for whom he felt a love like that of Jonathan
for David, may have had more or less influence
upon his capacity to enjoy scenery or the remains
of antiquity: for the writer looked upon Philæ as
one of the most interesting localities of the lower Nile,
and cannot but regard the ruined temple as one of the
grandest in Egypt. They visited the fields, villages,
the tombs, the ancient quarry, wherein half-sculptured
statues and columns still remain unmoved, and after a
day of antiquarian research they rode back to their
boat, as he said “with heavy hearts.” The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
came the hour of parting; and these two men, one a
young man, the other an elderly gentleman, who had
been utter strangers forty days before, now clung to
each other with the sincerest brotherly love and
parted in tears. How little did Mr. Taylor think, as
he saw the boat sailing away for Cairo with the Saxe-Coburg
colors at the peak, where he had so long kept
the Stars and Stripes, that they would meet again in
the sunny southern lands of Europe, and that another
person would join their company for life and make up
what he termed “a sacred triad.” He thought then that
the parting might be for all time. He was going into
an unknown wilderness, while his friend sought again
the lands of civilization: it was a long time before
either could dispel the gloom which their separation
left about them.</p>

<p class="caption">PHILÆ COLONNADE.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Taylor took another boat at Assouan and proceeded
to Korosko, where, with the assistance of the
Governor and a wild Arab chieftain, whose friendship
was purchased by presents and sociability, he secured
the necessary camels and outfit for a trip across the
desert. It was a hazardous undertaking for a stranger,
alone, unknown, to traverse the desert. If he was
murdered, none of the authorities would care, nor
would his death become known. He might contract
the terrible fever. He was liable to be eaten by wild
beasts, and he ran great risk of dying of thirst or hunger
on the hot sands of a trackless desert. The way
had been travelled many times before, but was all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
more dangerous because of the opportunity it gave
robbers to lie in wait for tourists. But he unhesitatingly
entered upon the journey, trusting in the friendship
of his Nubian and Arabian servants, and in his
own ability to withstand the heat of the sands and the
attacks of African fever. Camping in the desert
sands, riding a dromedary in the scorching sun, living
upon rudely prepared food, drinking lukewarm water,
with the sight of bones and carcasses by the way to
warn him, and the occasional appearance of sickly returning
caravans to dishearten him, he passed that arm
of the desert between the first cataract of the Nile and
Abou-Hammed. Thence his little caravan of six camels
followed the winding river to a small town, El
Mekheyref, where he dismissed his friendly companions,
excepting one, who had accompanied him from Cairo,
and set sail again on the Nile. Everywhere he was
received with kindness and hospitality by the natives
and by the Governors. His servants were so much
interested in his welfare that they told the natives that
he was a high official in the country from which he
came, and he was treated with the respect the Eastern
people think is due to persons of high rank. All disclaimers
from him were considered to be actuated by
feelings of modesty and elevated him in the estimation
of his entertainers.</p>

<p>His visit to Meroe was an interesting episode in his
long pilgrimage, although he did not make such diligent
search as an antiquarian among its crumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
walls as he had done in some of the other ancient cities.
Yet his descriptions of that place are most vivid pictures
and convey an idea of the topography of the
capital of that ancient kingdom in a manner most
readable to the stranger and very important to students
of history.</p>

</div>

<p>The journey from Meroe to Khartoum on the Ethiopian
Nile, Mr. Taylor enjoyed very much, having little
to do but amuse the sailors and be in turn amused
with stories of Mohammed, of Haroun-al-Raschid, and
the oriental wonders contained in songs and traditions.
The climate gave him health, his genial good-nature
brought him friends, and his experience would supply
the necessities of life in after years. There were narrow
escapes from animals, men, and treacherous rapids;
but he had become accustomed to such things, and
assumed enough of the Arab character to exclaim with
them, at each escape, “It is the will of Allah.” The
day before he arrived at Khartoum was Mr. Taylor’s
twenty-seventh birthday.</p>

<p>Having letters to many of the officials of Khartoum,
which was a military and trading station at the junction
of the Blue and the White Nile, he received a cordial
welcome, which made him feel at once that he was
among friends. He was then at the extreme outskirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of civilization. All beyond was dark and unknown.
Trading caravans consisting of Arabs and natives often
visited the interior, and small boats frequently went
farther up the Nile for purposes of traffic. But there
was little known about the people, the topography
of the country, or of the course of the Nile. There
was a Catholic mission at Khartoum, where the missionaries
treated Mr. Taylor with great consideration
and kindness. Some of them had made exploring
excursions into the wilds of Central Africa, and it was
his hope that he could get into some expedition with
them during that season. But in that he was disappointed.
None of the missionaries were intending to
visit the tribes to the south that season, and no other
suitable opportunity presented itself. He did not give
up the hope of seeing the unexplored regions of the
interior, until he had exhausted every means in his
power for procuring a fit escort. The unfortunate combination
of circumstances, which prevented him from
searching for the sources of the Nile, postponed the
revelations which he would have made, until they were
unfolded by another newspaper correspondent, H. M.
Stanley.</p>

<p>So persistent was Mr. Taylor in his purpose to travel
beyond the boundaries of the known, that he resolved
to go up the White Nile alone, except a few servants.
He had met Captain Peele, whose accounts of the curiosities
to be found farther inland made him the more
anxious to get a glimpse beyond. So he hired a boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and amid the doubts of his servants and the misgivings
of his new-found friends, he set sail up the White Nile.
He could not hire the boatmen for a long voyage, as
they feared the fierce cannibals of the interior, and as
they were going beyond the protection of any military
force. Trusting to his persuasive powers, he started
with them, deciding to go just as far as he could get
them to accompany him.</p>

<p>On a lone river, where no other sail was to be seen;
in a wilderness, where even the human beings were as
the lions and hyenas; with no friend of his own race
near him, he sailed on, in confidence, never seeming to
think that he might die there alone and never be heard
of by his relatives again. Crocodiles, hippopotami,
and giraffes flourished there, and man was the plaything
of both elements and beasts. Through the
wildest scenery, among the strangest birds and animals,
he pursued his course, trembling night and day lest
his crew should at any moment refuse to go farther.</p>

<p>At last they came to the country of the Shillooks.
That wild tribe of negroes was known to the boatmen
through nursery tales and traditional stories, wherein
the savages were given very bad names; and when
Mr. Taylor informed them that he purposed to visit
the village of those horrid man-eaters, they regarded
him with looks of the most profound astonishment.
But with a hardihood that by its boldness secured acquiescence,
he commanded them to row him to the
banks of the Nile, where the long rows of primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
huts were to be seen. Through captives and merchants
the kingdom of the Shillooks had become partially
known, and a kind of jargon, like the pigeon-English
of the Chinese, served the purposes of communication.
One of Mr. Taylor’s company could talk with them
slightly, and with him as an interpreter, and another
servant for a protector, he walked boldly into the village
of the savages, taking no weapons, lest he should
create suspicion. But they received him coldly and
with much show of suspicion and treachery. It was a
most dangerous experiment, and it is a matter of wonder
that he was allowed to depart. There were large
numbers of armed men around him, brandishing spears
and clubs, and demanding of him all sorts of impossible
presents. But with a calmness and seeming confidence,
Mr. Taylor smoked with the chief, and exchanged
presents with the subordinate officials, until they
became friendly and docile, laying down their weapons
and conversing cheerfully through the interpreter.
Yet they laid a plan for plundering the party, and
would at the last perhaps have murdered the whole
crew, had not Mr. Taylor most adroitly and coolly
foiled them in their designs.</p>

<p>All attempts to persuade his men to go farther were
useless. No urging, no promise of gifts, no threats
would induce them to sail farther south, as they believed
that it was but a little way to “the end of the
world.” How eagerly he yearned for some chance to
explore the country beyond, he often mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
after life. He was at the centre of a mighty continent.
Locked and bolted it had been for all the ages,
and it appeared as if the door was now open and he had
only to walk in to discover its treasures. But alas!
he could not go on alone. He could not swim the
length of the river, nor find his way among the elephants
and lions of the jungle. The boat turned back
toward Khartoum, and he had no choice but to return
with it.</p>

<p>However, he made the most of the trip, and frequently
visited the shore and had some very pleasant
and instructive interviews with the tribes who live in
that region. At one place he visited a village of the
Hassaniyehs, and contrary to the experience of many
other travellers, he was cordially invited to their circle
and treated with sincere hospitality. He mentioned
in his book the dance of welcome which the young
women of the village performed before him, and described
with interesting detail their motions, features,
forms, voices, and habits. Thus, with visits to savages,
interviews with wild beasts, and exquisite views
of the wildest scenery ever beheld by man, he floated
back to the friends and dwellings of Khartoum.</p>

<p>His stay in Khartoum, on his return, was brief,
because of the approaching sickly season; but every
hour of his time, when awake, was occupied in visiting
and being visited. Native chiefs, Arab merchants,
holy men of the Moslem faith, Catholic priests, princesses,
soldiers, consuls, boatmen, and tame lions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
seemed equally at home in his presence; and his stay
was a most delightful one for all concerned. His
parting with his friends at Khartoum was akin to the
separation of life-long friends, or the breaking of a
family circle. To him the whole world was kin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SCENE IN NORTH AFRICA.</p>
</div>

<p>From Khartoum he travelled in a caravan of camels,
chartered by him for an escort, leaving the Nile
and striking into the desert. With camel-drivers
hard to control, with a burning sun overhead, and
sands nearly as hot beneath, he traversed the desert
unharmed. Once he slept with a deadly snake under
his blanket, unconscious of his fearful danger until he
rolled up his blanket in the morning. The open air,
the free sun, sleeping on the sand, and eating the
coarse food of the natives, gave him a vigor and
healthy delight which inconveniences and dangers
could not overcome. Sometimes the heat was so
intense that the skin of his face peeled off, and once
or twice he felt the effects of “the desert intoxication,”
resulting from the monotonous scene and terrible heat.
It was a dizzy sensation, and is often thought to be a
symptom of dangerous disease. Changing camels
at intermediate stations, and visiting the ruins of
ancient cities and fortresses, where he found them
cropping out of the sand or adorning some rugged
mountain, he travelled on to Abdom, Dongola and
Wady-Halfa, where he embarked in a boat for Assouan.
His parting with his old dromedary, and with
his guides, at Wady-Halfa, is mentioned by him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the same regret that he experienced in leaving his
other friends. But his farewell, in Cairo, to his trusted
servant Achmet, who had been his faithful companion
from Cairo up the Nile and back, drew tears from the
eyes of both.</p>

<p>His voyage from Wady-Halfa to Cairo was so nearly
like his trip up the Nile, that for the purposes of this
work it is necessary only to say that he visited many
scenes and many ruins which were omitted on his way
up the river, and refreshed his memory by a second
visit to the most celebrated localities. He met many
travellers, and heard from civilization again, arriving
in the capital of Egypt on the first day of April, 1852,
in excellent spirits and in good health, save a troublesome
soreness of the eyes, caused by the reflection of
the sun on the water. The thin and frail body had
assumed a fullness and strength surprising to note, and
the broken heart had so accustomed itself to its load of
grief that the weight seemed lighter than at first.</p>

<p>On the Nile he wrote a poem containing among
others, these expressive lines:—</p>

</div>

<p>If there is any land where every grain of sand and
every blade of grass is pervaded by thrilling associations,
that land is Palestine. Especially and peculiarly
animated are its hills and vales to a poet such as
Taylor proved to be. It may be that some superficial
and matter-of-fact people who have visited the Holy
Land in the hot season, have not felt the charm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
its sacredness, owing to heat, barrenness, vermin,
and beggars. There may be a small class of iconoclastic
jokers, who, caring not how holy or tender the
theme, never fail to use it for ridicule, if it suits their
humoristic purpose. But the large class of travellers
who visit Jerusalem and the country round about, feel
the inspiring presence of the Past, and enjoy in an indescribable
fullness the associations connected with it.
In a higher and nobler degree, the mind imbued with
poetic images, a ready imagination, and a keen
discernment of beauty in landscape or history, will
avail itself of the great opportunities for pleasure and
profit which such a land supplies. In this sense Mr.
Taylor enjoyed a great advantage. He made his
physical being so subordinate to his mental, that no
fatigue, no hunger, no thirst, no annoyance from beggars,
nor fears of robbers, could interfere with the
appreciation of the beautiful. How greatly he enjoyed
his visit to Palestine, none but intimate friends ever
knew. In his letters, he often gave way to enthusiastic
expressions, and in his book, often gave very vivid
descriptions of what had been, as well as that which
then existed. But a fear of exaggeration through
praise, and a modest misgiving lest his poetical fancy
should not suit his readers, led him to write in a more
prosy vein than he talked. In conversation with
friends in Germany and America, and often in his
lectures, after he had finished his tours, he graphically
pictured the impressive events of the past connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with Palestine, which seemed to pass like a panorama
before him. To him, such a land would be full of
interest, whether he trod its fields at a time of the
year when it was luxuriant, or at a season when the
sun and simoon have made it a desert. To lie upon
its burning sands and dream of the sweltering hosts
that fought around the spot; to bask in the cool shades
of its olives and cedars, and think of Gethsemane and
the sweets of Sharon; to stand on the summit of the
Mount of Olives, Carmel, or Hermon, and realize the
almost overwhelming fact that before him were the
plains, hills, valleys, conquered and reconquered since
man was made, and which were peopled by the great,
the good, the wild, and the bloodthirsty of every
age; to recognize the localities where dwelt or fought
the heroes of Holy Writ; to feel the presence of the
King of kings as “on mysterious wings” he swept
the plain and shielded his people; to walk on the
very path whereon the Son of God had often placed
his feet; to dream in the starlight of Apostles, priests,
Romans, Crusaders, and Saracens, was an experience
especially gratifying to him, and interesting to a
greater or less degree to all travellers. The writer
recalls, perhaps in an imperfect form, a verse which
Mr. Taylor wrote during his stay in Palestine, and
which came to the writer with singular force while
carelessly wandering along the valley between Jerusalem
and the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thy strength, Jerusalem, is o’er,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And broken are thy walls;</div>
<div class="verse">The harp of Israel sounds no more</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In thy deserted halls:</div>
<div class="verse">But where thy Kings and Prophets trod,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Triumphant over death,</div>

<div class="verse">Still haunts the awful olive-shade</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>To him the past was real. He saw the fields of
corn, the ancient olive-trees, the high walls, and the
high towers, upon which the Saviour looked. He
saw again Abraham, Samuel, Saul, David, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Pilate, and their associates. He walked in
imagination in the welcoming crowd as they strewed
the branches along the path from Bethany to Jerusalem.
He saw the council chamber, the cross, and the
ascension. He dreamed of the gathering armies at
Antioch and Joppa, whose banners at last waved over
the palace of Godfrey of Bouillon in Jerusalem. To
him the gates of history swung wide open, and he
wandered back through the centuries, meeting patriarch
and maiden, shepherd and warrior, prophet and
judge, seer and apostle, in a companionship social and
confidential. It was like long generations of experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to walk those hallowed fields and realize the
wonderful tales of history. In this, as much as in the
views of the present, is found the profit resulting from
travel in such lands. One lives over the tales of
which he has read, with each locality serving as a
fresh reminder of the unnoted details. He is an old
man in experience who has travelled in the right spirit
over those eldest lands of the world; and few indeed
is the number of tourists who can feel that they have
done so.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor, like Longfellow, Tennyson, and Scott,
had a gift of looking through the present into the past,
and held delightful communion with the old days. Trying,
however, with a laudable desire to instruct his
readers, he kept studiously close to the simple facts of
his actual experience, and in his narrative seldom
allowed himself to fall into poetical expressions.</p>

<p>He left Egypt about the middle of the month of
April and landed at Beyrout, which was not at that
time, nor since, a very attractive locality. It was
made more unpleasant to him by an incarceration in a
kind of prison called the “Quarantine.” But with a
resignation worthy of the oldest Turk, he made the
best of his circumstances, and judging by the account
he has given of it, he had an easy, jolly time of it.
Released from the prison he travelled down the shore
of the Mediterranean to Tyre, with whose remnant he
seems to have been deeply impressed. The old Tyre,
with its fleets, with its enormous stocks of merchandise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with its lofty piles of cedar timber, with its
gorgeous purple robes, with its bulwarks and battlements,
with its armed defenders and hosts of besiegers,
arose from its crumbled fragments and passed
through the panoramic changes which so startle the
student of Syrian history.</p>

<p>After leaving the village which now replaces the
ancient city, he rode down the sandy shore and composed
a poem which was afterwards somewhat changed,
but in which was retained the boldness of the waves,
which then beat at his feet.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The wild and windy morning is lit with lurid fire;</div>
<div class="verse">The thundering surf of ocean beats on the rocks of Tyre,—</div>
<div class="verse">Beats on the fallen columns and round the headland roars,</div>
<div class="verse">And hurls its foamy volume along the hollow shores,</div>
<div class="verse">And calls with angry clamor, that speaks its long desire:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Where are the ships of Tarshish, the mighty ships of Tyre?’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Within her cunning harbor, choked with invading sand,</div>
<div class="verse">No galleys bring their freightage, the spoils of every land,</div>
<div class="verse">And like a prostrate forest, when autumn gales have blown,</div>
<div class="verse">Her colonnades of granite lie shattered and o’erthrown;</div>
<div class="verse">And from the reef the pharos no longer flings its fire,</div>
<div class="verse">To beacon home from Tarshish, the lordly ships of Tyre.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Where is the wealth of ages that heaped thy princely mart?</div>
<div class="verse">The pomp of purple trappings; the gems of Syrian art;</div>
<div class="verse">The silken goats of Kedar; Sabæa’s spicy store;</div>
<div class="verse">The tributes of the islands thy squadrons homeward bore,</div>
<div class="verse">When in thy gates triumphant they entered from the sea</div>
<div class="verse">With sound of horn and sackbut, of harp and psaltery.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Though silent and forgotten, yet Nature still laments</div>
<div class="verse">The pomp and power departed, the lost magnificence:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The hills were proud to see thee, and they are sadder now;</div>
<div class="verse">The sea was proud to bear thee, and wears a troubled brow,</div>
<div class="verse">And evermore the surges chant forth their vain desire:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Where are the ships of Tarshish, the mighty ships of Tyre?’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most sublime experiences of life is to
stand where he stood, with the great waves rolling up
the beach and shaking the earth with their powerful
surges, and with the spray breaking about the dark
ruins of the ancient city, and there repeat the poem
from which the above verses are taken. It gives
power and life to the words which can never be felt or
seen by those who have never heard the bellowings or
felt the shocks of the Mediterranean surf.</p>

<p>From Tyre he ascended Mount Carmel, and following
the shore to Jaffa, took the usual route to Jerusalem.
It was the most pleasant season of the year
(April), and all vegetation was fast springing into its
bountiful life. The cactus, orange, and pomegranate
were in bloom, and all nature seemed in its most
cheerful mood. So like a paradise did it look to him,
that it was some little time before he could get into that
frame of mind which brought a realization that he was
in that land of great renown. But as that thrilling
moment arrived when he stepped upon the highest
plateau of the mountains near Jerusalem and looked
with astonished eyes over the valley and on the “City
of our God and the mountain of his holiness,” he felt,
with a sudden thrill, that he was in the presence of
the Great and the Holy. With emotions that cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
be described he rode over those sacred fields and
entered the gates of the city.</p>

<p>From Jerusalem he made an excursion, by the way
of Bethany, to the Dead Sea. It was a sultry day,
and he suffered much from the heat, having therein a
suggestion of the rain of fire and brimstone which
destroyed the cities whose ruins are supposed to be
petrified at the bottom of the Dead Sea. With his
usual hardihood he plunged fearlessly into the bituminous
waters of the Dead Sea, and seemed to enjoy what
no traveller who has since indulged in that bath is
known to have enjoyed, the buoyance of the water and
the sensations caused by the volcanic materials held in
solution.</p>

<p>On his return to the city he remained for several
days examining the sacred localities and contending
with the crowds of beggars and guides who blocked
the narrow and filthy streets of Jerusalem. The
wretchedness, poverty, disease, and filth of the people
are so prominent and so loathsome, that unless the
ordinary traveller keeps constantly on his guard, he
will forget all the old and holy associations in his disgust
for the city of to-day. It is said that the city
is less dirty and less stricken with disease than it was
in 1850. If such be the fact, it is a marvel indeed how
Mr. Taylor ever found a fit place for his Muse, which
so frequently visited him there. He seems, however,
to have been deeply interested in everything, having
about as little faith in what the guides told him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the locality of the Holy Sepulchre, Calvary, Gethsemane,
and the true cross, as travellers in more modern
times appear to entertain. Jerusalem was not
only all that we have represented it to be outwardly,
but the people would lie beyond the fables of any other
people; would steal and would murder. To be much
troubled by these facts would destroy the poetry of the
place, and Mr. Taylor allowed none of those things to
move him. He wrote of the facts as he found them,
uncolored by the imagination, and seems to have
flattered himself that he was not as sentimental as the
travellers who had preceded him. If he was so very
practical, whence such beautiful poetry?</p>

</div>

<p>On the 7th of May he left Jerusalem, in company
with another traveller and the mule-drivers, taking the
route by way of Samaria to Nazareth through a
country at that season covered with the richest and
freshest foliage. Along the entire route the tourist
seldom passes out of sight of broken columns, falling
fortresses, gray old monasteries, dismal hermitages,
and Roman masonry. The olive and fig trees shaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the path, and with the wide fields of grain gave the
appearance of thrift and enterprise. He visited Shechem,
where it is said that Joseph was buried, and
near which he was thrown into the pit by his brethren.
There Mr. Taylor saw Samaritans of the original
stock, and there he was shown an ancient manuscript
of Hebrew Law, said to be three thousand years old.</p>

<p>He made a short stop at Nazareth and was shown
where the mother of Christ had resided, the table
from which Christ ate, and the school-room (?) in
which Christ is said to have been taught.</p>

<p>Going thence he ascended Mount Tabor, as it was
his custom to climb all the mountains he could
reach, and then hastened on to the Sea of Galilee.
There he swam in its crystal water, and visited the
Mount of Beatitudes, Joseph’s Well, and Magadala,
the home of Mary Magdalene. Passing Cesarea
Philippi, and crossing the anti-Lebanon range of
mountains in imminent danger of robbery and death
from the rebellious tribes of Druses which inhabited
that region, they came out on the afternoon of May
19th in view of the lovely city of Damascus.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor made a sketch of himself as he appeared
in his Eastern costume, while seated on an eminence
that afternoon, overlooking the most ancient city in the
world. In one of the rooms of Mr. Taylor’s lovely
home of Cedarcroft there hangs a large painting, of
considerable merit, and said to be an excellent portrait,
which was executed by a friend from that sketch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
It represents Mr. Taylor sitting in Oriental posture,
on the mountain-side, with the domes, minarets, and
embowered walls of Damascus on the distant plain.
He always held that painting to be a treasure, connecting
him, as it did, with those scenes of early
travel, and with the friend who made the painting,
and with those who admired it.</p>

<p>He was delighted with Damascus. It was placed
in the centre of a plain whereon grew in the greatest
abundance all the fruits and all the varieties of leaf
and blossom known to the tropic zone. No other
spot yet explored can boast such beautiful trees; such
a profusion of roses; such blossoms of jessamine and
pomegranate; such loads of walnuts, figs, olives, apricots;
such luxuriant grasses, and such productive
fields, as that land which has been cultivated by man
the longest. Nature has set the crown upon Damascus
and blessed it with a superabundance of vegetable
life. But what is given to verdure seems to be taken
from humanity, for, regarded as a whole, he found the
people of the city to be a rather bad lot. Yet there,
as elsewhere, he found agreeable companions and
warm friends. He made himself so much at home that
he soon appeared like a native, and all the labyrinths of
bazars and alleys were as familiar to him after a few
days’ stay as they seemed to be to the oldest resident.
He liked their life so well that he soon learned to enjoy
to its full the physical comfort and mental rest of the
Turkish bath. He ever after referred to the bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at Damascus as the acme of bodily satisfaction. The
fact that so many travellers have been disappointed in
the enjoyment of the bath does not show Mr. Taylor’s
account to be so much overdrawn, as it shows the difference
between the pleasure to be derived from the
pastimes of any people by those who adhere more or
less to their own tastes and customs, and those who,
like Mr. Taylor, fall wholly and heartily into the ways
and thoughts of the native. When in Damascus, he
not only did as they do outwardly, but he set his mind
in the same channel, and knew what it was to be a
Turk in aspirations as well as in dress. No other
traveller known to literature ever entered so completely
into the experience and social companionship
of the people whom he visited.</p>

<p>In order that he might leave no habit untried which
came within his reach, he took a potion of hashish, to
test its strength and effects. The drug did not begin
to intoxicate him quite as soon as he expected, and
he doubled the dose, thus taking six times as much as
would intoxicate an ordinary Turk. It made him
terribly ill; and it was almost miraculous that he survived
the shock to his system. He did not try the
strength of that drug again. Among the friends he
made, and whose home he visited at Damascus, was a
family of Maronite Christians, who, eight years later,
were heinously butchered by the Moslems during the
great massacre following the Druses’ and Marnoites’
dispute in 1860.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right">—<cite>Taylor’s Oriental Idyl.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Damascus Mr. Taylor journeyed to Baalbec,
where are the most imposing ruins to be found in
Syria, and where stand six of the most symmetrical
and exquisitely carved columns to be seen in Asia or
Europe. He described the temples and fragments so
vividly, that travellers who have taken his “Lands of
the Saracen” for a guide have seldom been disappointed
or mistaken in their anticipations, the actual scene
they look upon being so like the image they formed in
their minds while reading his description. The gift
of portraying through the combination of words and
sentences an accurate picture of a city existing in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
strange land and amid a strange people, is a rare gift,
and the number is very few of those who are found to
possess it. Mr. Taylor was one of those privileged
ones. In his description we see the columns, cornices,
pediments, walls, platforms, broken pillars, and falling
pavilions as distinctly as they appear when we afterwards
look upon those romantic piles with the natural
eye. To him, as to others, it was a study to determine,
if possible, how such enormous blocks of stone,
sixty-two feet long and ten feet in diameter, could
have been transported and placed in the buildings.
It is beyond all the skill of to-day to move nine thousand
tons of stone in a single block with the conveniences
of that time.</p>

<p>From Baalbec he ascended the Lebanon range of
mountains, and looked over the land from the snowy
peak of one of its lofty summits. He visited the
sacred cedars which have lived on the mountain-side
for three thousand years, and then rode on through
chasms, along cliffs, and by the sweetest and richest
dells, until he descended to the plain of Beyrout.</p>

<p>His appreciation of the hills of Lebanon is more
clearly seen in his poetry than in his prose. For,
when writing of them afterwards, he said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Lebanon, thou mount of story,</div>
<div class="verse">Well we know thy sturdy glory,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Since the days of Solomon;</div>
<div class="verse">Well me know the Five old Cedars,</div>
<div class="verse">Scarred by ages,—silent pleaders,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Preaching in their gray sedateness,</div>
<div class="verse">Of thy forest’s fallen greatness,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the vessels of the Tyrian</div>
<div class="verse">And the palaces Assyrian</div>
<div class="verse">And the temple on Moriah</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To the High and Holy One!</div>
<div class="verse">Know the wealth of thy appointment—</div>
<div class="verse">Myrrh and aloes, gum and ointment;</div>
<div class="verse">But we knew not, till we clomb thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the nectar dropping from thee,—</div>
<div class="verse">Of the pure, pellucid Ophir</div>
<div class="verse">In the cups of vino d’oro,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On the hills of Lebanon!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In that city he laid his plans for the future, and
abandoned his purposed trip to the Euphrates and
Tigris. He relinquished the design to visit Assyria
with great reluctance, and decided to pass through the
interior of Asia Minor to Constantinople. Acting
immediately upon this resolution, without an apparent
doubt of being able to traverse safely the unknown
interior of Asia Minor, he engaged a vessel and sailed
up the coast to the Orontes River, and thence to Aleppo.
In that city, by a ludicrous mistake, Mr. Taylor and
his travelling companion were invited to the house of
one of the wealthiest merchants, and were treated with
the greatest hospitality by the owner, who supposed
they were titled Englishmen. But when the mistake
was revealed, Mr. Taylor had become such an agreeable
visitor that his host insisted upon entertaining them
during their stay in Aleppo. He had been there but
a few days before he became such a general favorite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that he was invited to call on the nobility, was urged
to attend feasts, balls, and weddings, and when he left
the city, the friendly regrets of hundreds of Moslems
and Christians followed him.</p>

<p>Leaving Aleppo early in June, he followed the
shore of the Mediterranean around to the plain of Issus,
where Alexander the Great won his great victory, and
thence to Tarsus, the birthplace of the Apostle Paul.
It may have been “no mean city” when Paul was born,
but it was a most insignificant village when Mr. Taylor
was there. But as the magnificent mountains of
the Taurus range loomed up along the northern horizon,
his attention was taken from rags, beggary, and ruined
fortresses, to snowy cliffs, over which he had a passion
for clambering.</p>

<p>Those persons who have ascended the Alps at the
Simplon pass, have a very good idea of the Taurus
mountains, and can realize somewhat of Mr. Taylor’s
satisfaction as he rode up the gorges and peered into
the deep valleys. He loved the mountains anywhere.
But the Taurus seemed then, in the glow of his return
to perfect health and with all the profusion of nature’s
living beauties blooming about him, and the eternal
snows gleaming above him, to be the most attractive
landscape in the world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O deep, exulting freedom of the hills!</div>
<div class="verse">O summits vast, that to the climbing view,</div>
<div class="verse">In naked glory stand against the blue!</div>
<div class="verse">O cold and buoyant air, whose crystal fills</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Heaven’s amethystine bowl! O speeding streams,</div>
<div class="verse">That foam and thunder from the cliffs below!</div>
<div class="verse">O slippery brinks and solitudes of snow,</div>
<div class="verse">And granite bleakness, where the vulture screams!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His visit to Konia (Iconium), the capital of Karamania,
was full of little episodes and personal incidents,
which he told afterwards in print in his own inimitable
manner. But nothing of unusual moment occurred
until he reached ancient Phrygia, where the ruins of
olden cities and fortresses interested him much. Their
history was almost as unknown as the story of the
temples of Yucatan, and consequently had a mysterious
appearance which charms in a bewildering way the
study of a poet.</p>

<p>Riding on over hills and mountains, across delightful
streams, through fertile valleys, associating with the
Turks on friendly terms, and studying their habits and
language, Mr. Taylor pushed fearlessly into the very
heart of Asia Minor. Visiting Oezani in its debris,
and the valley of Rhyndacus, they traversed the primeval
forests on the Mysian Olympus, and true to his
instincts he sought the heights of Olympus, twin mountain,
in size and literature, with its Grecian namesake.
From that point to Brousa, near the Sea of Marmora, it
was but a day’s journey, and seems to have been the
most delightful ride of the whole tour. Gardens,
orchards, grain-fields, thickets of clematis and roses,
patches of beech and oak woodland, and brilliant streams
pleased the eye, while the songs of birds and of happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
harvesters charmed the ear. Grand mountains pierced
the skies, covered with dense forests, behind them, and
the plain stretched away—a Garden of Eden—to
the shore of a placid inland sea.</p>

<p>They entered Brousa in excellent health and spirits,
having seen no unusual fatigue and been in no great
danger during the whole journey through a country
then almost lost and unknown to the civilized world.</p>

<p>From Brousa, the party descended to the Sea of
Marmora, and taking a sail-boat were wafted by the
Golden Horn into the interminable fleets of Constantinople.
During his stay in that city he witnessed the
display of the Turkish holidays, saw the Sultan on his
throne, entered the mosque of Saint Sophia, ran to the
numerous conflagrations, and unravelled to his satisfaction
some of the social and political problems connected
with the Sultan’s rule and the state of popular
discontent. He foretold a war with Russia, and a
contest between the latter and England over the coveted
gem of the East and the gate to the Black Sea.
His predictions have already been proven to be true,
showing an insight into political affairs wholly unlooked
for in a young man, and not to be found in
such as had travelled to less purpose.</p>

<p>On leaving Constantinople, he proceeded again to
Smyrna, which place appeared to so much better
advantage on his second visit than it did at his first,
that instead of leaving it, as before, with anathemas,
he celebrated his visit with a poem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The ‘Ornament of Asia’ and the ‘Crown</div>
<div class="verse">Of fair Ionia.’ Yea, but Asia stands</div>
<div class="verse">No more an empress, and Ionia’s hands</div>
<div class="verse">Have lost their sceptre. Thou, majestic town,</div>
<div class="verse">Art as a diamond on a faded robe.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reader may not need to be again reminded of
Mr. Taylor’s double view of the scenes he visited, or
of the fact that he tried to give faithful pictures of the
present in his prose and left the ideal and fanciful to
his books of poetry. But to understand his disposition,
and correctly estimate his ability, they need to
be read together; and hence, before taking leave of
Asia Minor, we venture to quote a verse from a dedication
to his friend Richard H. Stoddard, which we
have seen in a volume of Mr. Taylor’s poems.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O Friend, were you but couched on Tmolus’ side,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In the warm myrtles, in the golden air</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of the declining day, which half lays bare,</div>
<div class="verse">Half drapes, the silent mountains and the wide</div>
<div class="verse">Embosomed vale, that wanders to the sea;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And the far sea, with doubtful specks of sail,</div>
<div class="verse">And farthest isles, that slumber tranquilly</div>

<div class="verse">And the ripe brain but sheds abortive seed.</div>
<div class="verse">But I am solitary, and the curse,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or blessing, which has clung to me from birth—</div>
<div class="verse">The torment and the ecstasy of verse—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Comes up to me from the illustrious earth</div>
<div class="verse">Of ancient Tmolus; and the very stones,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Reverberant, din the mellow air with tones</div>
<div class="verse">Winch the sweet air remembers; and they blend</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With fainter echoes, which the mountains fling</div>
<div class="verse">From far oracular caverns: so, my Friend,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">I cannot choose but sing.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Constantinople Mr. Taylor heard of the action
which had been taken by the United States, looking to
the opening of the ports of Japan to the commerce of
America. He heard that a squadron was to leave the
United States in November, under the command of
Commodore Perry, and he formed the resolution to
connect himself with the expedition, if possible. To
that end he wrote to his friends and employers in New
York, asking them to obtain permission for him to join
the fleet. Not knowing just when the expedition
would sail, nor at what ports it would stop on its way
to Japan, he anxiously watched for information, and
inquired at every place where information was likely
to be found.</p>

<p>He was determined to visit Spain before he went to
China and Japan, and was equally resolved to visit
the home of his German travelling companion who
ascended the Nile with him, and who had sent pressing
invitations to him to come to Gotha.</p>

<p>The business details connected with his finances and
outfit for Spain and China also called him to London,
and arranging his tour so as to accomplish these
diverse ends he visited Malta, where he was delayed
ten days, and then sailed to Sicily, where he witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the Catanian centennial festival in honor of St.
Agatha, and where he beheld the awful spectacle of
Ætna in eruption. From Sicily he sailed up the coast
to that Naples which, as a wayfarer in Rome seven
years before, he had so much longed to see, and filled
his letters with praises of its beautiful bay and charming
circle of mountain, city, town, cliffs, and islands.
Without changing steamers he proceeded to Leghorn,
and going to Florence experienced that delight of all
delights,—in Florence a second time. Feeling that
his time was limited, and “drawn by an unseen influence,”
he hastened on to Venice, and thence through
the regions of the Austrian Tyrol to Munich and
Gotha.</p>

<p>Gladsome days at Gotha! Was it not the country
of his beloved friend? Was it not the home of his
friend’s niece, Marie Hansen? The daughter of the
great astronomer, Peter Andreas Hansen, was a worthy
child of a noble sire. Mr. Taylor had listened to her
praises, but had hardly hoped to meet her.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After a few weeks spent in and about that pleasant
city, to which he was destined to return and claim his
bride, and in which he was to pass many of the sweetest
days of his life, he journeyed to London. There
he made his arrangements for a trip into China, and
hastened away to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>On the 6th of November he left the great rock and
took passage in a steamer for Cadiz, in Spain. There
he walked the streets three thousand years old, and
wherein, it is said, that Hercules strode. Yet there is
but little now to be seen that would remind one of antiquity.
He noticed, however, the beautiful and graceful
women. From Cadiz he went by boat up the Guadalquiver
River to the pretty town of Seville. There
were the old Moorish houses; there the massive Cathedral;
there the Saracenic palace of Alcazar, with all
its porches, galleries, arches, and sculptures; there
was the palace called Pilate’s House, with its decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
from Arabia, and inscriptions from the Koran;
and there was the museum containing Murillo’s best
paintings.</p>

<p>But it requires only a short time to visit all the
attractions of Seville, and Mr. Taylor soon proceeded
to Granada. In nearly all the cities which he visited
he was reminded, directly or indirectly, of the visit of
his friend, Washington Irving. He found the same
guides, or lodged at the same hotel, or visited some
celebrated locality of which Irving had written.</p>

<p>In Granada was the celebrated fortress of Alhambra,
which was captured from the Moors by the troops
of Ferdinand and Isabella the same year that Columbus
discovered America; there was the palace of
Charles V.; there the Carthusian convent, the Monastery
of St. Geronimo, and there the cathedral with the
remains of Ferdinand and Isabella. He made a hasty
trip to Cordova and its ancient Moslem mosque.
Then, visiting Alhama, Malaga, and Ronda, he returned
hastily to Gibraltar and examined the renowned fortress,
said to be the strongest citadel in the world.</p>

<p>In that somewhat hasty view of Southern Spain he
obtained much valuable information and an experience
which often served him in his literary work as a
writer for the public press. Southern Spain and
Southern France, next to Rome itself, are replete with
warlike and romantic associations. Gauls, Romans,
Moors, and Spaniards, have made nearly every plain a
battle-field; and the toppling walls of the ancient towers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and palaces tell of the fiercest contests, the most
terrible inquisitions, and the narrowest of narrow
escapes. Song and story in prose and rhyme have
combined in every form to make the land attractive,
and it is a matter of deep regret that Mr. Taylor, who
was so capable of developing all these characteristics,
had not more time in which to visit them and write
out his experience.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting and valuable part of Mr.
Taylor’s experience as a traveller was in India, China,
and Japan, if we consider only the welfare of his
readers. But so far as its influence upon him was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
concerned, its impression was far less marked than
that in Europe and Egypt. At the time he left Gibraltar
for Egypt, the lands of India, China, and Japan
were comparatively little known to the reading communities
in America. Even India, which had so long
been the idol of England and the El Dorado for all her
adventurous spirits and valorous soldiers, was a country
with which America had but little communication,
and in whose people Americans took but little interest.
It was a neglected field.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor, in a letter to a friend in Washington,
laid much stress upon the importance to American
commerce of an accurate description of those lands,
and hoped to be the instrument by which an interest
in such enterprises might be awakened. It was a
laudable, patriotic purpose, and was most conscientiously
carried out by him.</p>

<p>He left Gibraltar on the 28th of November, on a
Peninsular and Oriental steamer, which touched at that
port, on its way from Southampton to Alexandria. He
arrived at Alexandria December 8, and sought his old
quarters in the city. He felt like one who returns to
his home, as he walked the streets of the Egyptian
city, and relates with evident satisfaction how pleasant
it was to call out to the crowd of donkey-drivers in
their native tongue.</p>

<p>But his visit to Cairo gave him the keenest delight,
as there he saw many familiar faces, and was greeted
with many welcoming smiles. He was especially delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to meet his faithful dragoman, Achmet, who
had been his companion on his trip to the White Nile,
and the happiness of the Egyptian on seeing his old
employer told very impressively the power and virtue
of Mr. Taylor’s character. Men were faithful to him
because he had faith in them. They loved him because
he understood and appreciated them. Even the little
donkey-boy on whose animal Mr. Taylor had rode a
year before in one of his reckless canters through the
bazaars, remembered him and offered to let him ride
again without pay—an act unheard of by other travellers
there. It could not be otherwise than sweet to
travel in any land where the people were friends and
where the wanderer was regarded in the light of an
especially intelligent relative.</p>

<p>At that date there were no railroads in Egypt,
although one was projected, and Mr. Taylor was compelled,
in common with the crowd of other travellers,
to ride in a cart, eighty-four miles, through the sandy
desert, to Suez. The latter town was then, according
to Mr. Taylor’s account, a small, dirty, insignificant
place. But the writer, who visited the place after a
visit to Japan, China, and India, in 1870, found a very
prosperous town, with excellent hotel accommodations.
The bazaar was large and stocked with an immense
quantity of goods from all parts of the civilized world.
It has doubtless grown much since the work was begun
on the Suez Canal, and since the harbor has been
dredged and the wharves constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>His stay in Suez was, however, very brief, as the
Mediterranean steamer had arrived much behind time,
and consequently all were hurried on board the little
tug, and soon walked the deck of an India steamer.</p>

<p>They were on the Red Sea! Now that its barren,
sandy shores, the home of the pelican and ostrich,
have become so familiar to tourists, and its glaring
surface been so often mentioned by correspondents,
there is less romance about a voyage from Suez to
Aden than in that comparatively early day when Mr.
Taylor visited the locality. There was the rugged
pass on the west, through which the pillar of fire led
the escaping Jews to the shore, and there was the
beach and highlands on the east, up which they
marched dry-shod from the bed of the sea, while the
waves rolled in on the hosts of Pharaoh. There was
the hill on which Miriam sang so exultingly; and
beyond, the hot peaks of the Sinaitic Wilderness.
Somewhere in the vicinity of that sea resided the
Queen of Sheba; and not far from its shores were
the forgotten mines of ancient Ophir.</p>

<p>But Mr. Taylor felt now that a patriotic duty rested
upon him, and avoiding the delicious flights of fancy
which pleased him so much in Europe, he devoted
himself to the practical things which might be of
advantage to his ambitious countrymen. So he told
about the sailors who were employed on the steamer,
where Hindoos did all the drudgery and Chinamen
prepared the food, under the direction of Europeans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
He described the character of the passengers, telling
where each came from and where they were going.
How he ascertained these facts is an enigma; but they
were important to commercial people who would compete
with the established lines, and who would like to
know whom to employ and who would be their patrons.
There were physicians, soldiers, officers, merchants,
and health-seekers, from each of whom Mr.
Taylor managed to gain much information. He did
not wait, like the fashionable tourist of this day, until
he arrived at his destination, trusting to luck for information
and accommodation. He closely studied the
country before he arrived there, and frequently astonished
his guides and native companions by showing a
much more accurate and extensive knowledge of their
country than they possessed who had lived there all
their lives.</p>

<p>He mentioned the hot red hills and the furnace-like
surface of the sea, saying that one part of the Red Sea
was the hottest part of the earth’s surface. But he
appears to have suffered less than he had in the desert,
and was quite happy with his biscuit and claret, and
lost no time with useless fans.</p>

<p>He saw Mocha from the deck of the steamer, and
immediately set about ascertaining what advantages
that port and town offered to commerce. Without
leaving the deck he found persons who knew all about
Arabia and its products; so he sits down and writes a
letter about coffee and its culture in and about Mocha.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
He was such a devoted lover of coffee that it may have
been a peculiarly interesting topic to him. At all
events, he wrote so intelligently that an old schoolmate,
who was engaged in foreign trade, acted profitably
on Mr. Taylor’s hints and started a son in the coffee-trade
at Baltimore. Mr. Taylor stated in his letter that
fifteen thousand tons of coffee were exported annually
from Mocha, it being raised in the interior and brought
to Mocha on camels. He said that foreign vessels
could best load at Aden, the English stronghold on
the south-west coast of Arabia, to which port the native
coasting vessels carried nearly all the exports of Mocha
and of the other small ports along the Red Sea. He
also gave the information that equally good coffee
could be obtained on the Abyssinian coast, and at a
smaller price.</p>

<p>He entered the port of Aden in the night, and was
startled to look out on the port in the morning and see
such jagged masses of black rock shooting up from
the sand one thousand five hundred feet. It is another
Gibraltar, and shrewdly has England held by diplomacy
what she obtained by such a show of force. But
the heat from the sand and barren rocks is so intense
that the quivers of a heated atmosphere are always
visible, and very injurious to the eyes. At the time
of Mr. Taylor’s visit, the town and the harbor were
wretched and dangerous; but in 1870 the writer
found a neat village, with good hotels, and a spacious
wharf. Mr. Taylor saw the advantages of the port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and predicted its growth. He mentioned the form,
features, and dispositions of the Arabians; and told
what interest the Parsees and Hindoos took in the
local trade. He mentioned the articles of commerce
to be found there, and gave the prices.</p>

<p>There is not to be found in his letters to the
“Tribune,” nor in his book, “India, China, and
Japan,” any mention of his sensations when he saw,
as he did at Aden, a fire-worshipper (Parsee) for the
first time. Being a poet by nature, and an admirer of
Moore, he must have been fascinated by the actual
presence of a Gheber with whom he could converse,
and with whom he could change English money into
the coin of the country. How “Lalla Rookh” comes
to the tongue’s end when we look a fire-worshipper in
the face and recognize the picture Moore had given of
him!</p>

<p>At Aden Mr. Taylor witnessed an incident which,
to one so broadly charitable and Christian, must have
been most revolting. One of the workmen, who had
been loading the steamer with coal, was asleep in the
hold when the vessel started, and the officers finding
him aboard after they had put to sea, forced the poor
native overboard and left him to float ashore with the
tide or perish in the waves. He whose land was
the world, whose brethren were all mankind, whose
friends were the humblest heathen as well as the titled
official, looked back at the dark speck on the waves,
and tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>From Aden, the steamer entered upon its trip across
the Indian Ocean, which was true to its reputation, and
was placid and peaceful as an inland lake. But the slow
steamer took nine days to sail from Suez to Bombay;
and by the time Mr. Taylor was brought into view of
the mountains where Brahma and Vishnu had so long
been worshipped, he had become acquainted with
nearly all the Hindoo sailors, and could secure unusual
attendance from the waiters by addressing them in the
Hindustanee language. He had learned the names of
the principal streets of Bombay, the names of the
richest merchants, and the kind of fare to be expected
at the hotels. So naturally did he fall into the ways
of the people that the boatmen who took him ashore
at Bombay mistook him for an old resident and carried
him ashore for one rupee, while charging the other passengers
three. He seated himself, or rather stretched
himself, into a palanquin carried by four men,—one at
each end of a long pole,—and like a native rode through
the streets of Bombay on the necks of servants. But
he did not enjoy that kind of conveyance; he had too
much sympathy with the human race to impose his
weight on the necks of human beings without misgiving,
and he afterwards refused to be carried about in
that way when mules were to be had.</p>

<p>At Bombay, he was received with the same good-will
and hospitality as he had found in other lands.
Parsees, Hindoos, English, and Arabians vied with
each other in giving him kindly attentions; the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
were pagan in religion, but Christian in generosity
and charity. It broadens one’s ideas of theology to be
thrown into communion with so many different nations
with as many different gods. But its tendency is to
confirm, rather than to unsettle, the belief in the
Christian doctrines. At all events, such was Mr. Taylor’s
experience; and such has been the effect upon
others.</p>

<p>He found the common people very servile, and lacking
in spirit, and attributed it to the long despotism.
But in them he found faithful friends, and learned to
respect them. They were nearly all pagans when he
was there, and worshipped their huge red idols with a
sincerity and self-sacrifice worthy of the highest profession.
In order to learn something of India in those
remote ages beyond the testimony of history, and even
back of the age of tradition, he visited the old temple
on the island of Elephanta, about seven miles from
Bombay. The massive structure, in partial ruin, so
wonderfully wrought and massively constructed, made
a deep impression upon his mind. Far, far back in the
uncounted ages, the foundations were laid by men who
were not low in the scale of civilization, if an idea of
the beautiful and the ability to embody it in forms of
stone be a test of enlightenment; it stands to-day,
defying time, as it has defied earthquakes and cannon-shot.
Into the fathomless future will it pass, an
immovable monument of the skill and art of man in
the childhood of human experience. In the statuary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Mr. Taylor found a strange resemblance to the three
ages of art; the statue of Brahma representing the
style of the Egyptian, Vishnu being represented in a
form and carving of the Greek style, while Siva was
cut from the stone in such a shape as to remind him of
the Mephistopheles of the German school of sculpture.</p>

<p>His keen scrutiny also developed the theory that
the pillars were rough copies of the poppy-stem and
the lotus-leaf. The latter was the emblem of sanctity
in the days of Brahma. Mr. Taylor’s suggestion has
been attractively enlarged upon and illustrated within
a few years by writers for English literary and art
periodicals.</p>

<p>No excursion from Bombay exceeds that to Elephanta
in romantic attractions; for there are not only
extensive ruins of greater and lesser temples, but the
landscape, wherein the greenest islands dot the sheen
of a gorgeous bay, is bright with most beautiful flowers
and bright leaves, and the air is permeated with
the odor of roses and cassia. Soon Elephanta will be
a “summer resort,” and Taylor’s description and reflections
will be sold by newsboys as a guide-book.</p>

<p>At Bombay he visited the large mercantile establishments
and investigated the prospects of trade; saw the
people in their homes, at meals, prayers, marriages, and
funerals, and studied the work of the carpenters in that
celebrated shipyard where was constructed the man-of-war
wherein the Star-Spangled Banner was written.
He knew all about the city as it was when he saw it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and as it had been from its Portuguese beginning;
and yet he remained but a single week. Who was the
simpleton that circulated an unauthorized statement
that Mr. Taylor travelled far and saw little? In fact,
he knew more of the needs and enterprise of Bombay
than many old residents.</p>

<p>In his haste to see as much of India as possible, and
yet arrive in China in season to join Commodore Perry’s
expedition to Japan, he determined to ride in one
of the mail carts of India a distance of nearly four
hundred miles. His new friends advised him not to
attempt the journey, and entertained him with the
deeds of assassins and robbers along the route, and
the results of the fatiguing ride of seven days and
nights in a two-wheeled vehicle without springs or
mattresses. But his mind was made up to go, and go
he would. So, regardless of warnings and advice, he
started into the interior in a cart with a driver and the
“Royal Mail.” The traveller who now lounges in the
luxuriant carriages of the railway trains between
Bombay and Calcutta, can have no idea of the trials
of such a journey as Mr. Taylor undertook. Then,
there were no railroads, no regular stages, even;
nothing but lumbering carts drawn by oxen and
decrepit old horses. But he endured the fatigue with
his usual fortitude and good fortune, while his already
remarkable experience among hospitable people was
repeated there in a most praiseworthy style. Friends,
friends, everywhere! Men divided their meals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
beds with him. People with whom he could converse
by signs only, gave him food and pressed themselves
into his service, and would take no pay. In one
place a soldier sat up all night to give the weary traveller
his bed. Surely, the essence of human kindness
and charity is not confined to Christian lands!</p>

<p>Through jungles, where there was not a single path;
along highways, crowded with innumerable carts;
riding in wildernesses, where water was scarce, and
food not to be found; in every kind of vehicle known
to the primitive people, from a horse chaise to a bullock-cart;
surrounded by miasmatic marshes, and the
lairs of tigers, he hurried on toward Delhi.</p>

<p>On his way he made a short stop at Agra and
Futtehpoor-Sikra, where stand some of the mightiest
and most costly temples which have been reared since
the beginning of the Christian era. It well repays
years of work and economy to wander among the
palaces, mosques, and mausoleums of those great cities.
No palace in all the world can be found to equal that of
Akbar, the great Mogul, at Agra. When Mr. Taylor
visited the city, nearly all the rubbish, made by wars
and sieges, had been cleared away, and the scarred
walls and marred mosaics had been restored, so that
he stood under mighty domes, amid all the splendor
of the East. No one can imagine its beauty and
grandeur, unless he has seen it. Such lofty arches!
such masses of pure white marble! such a profusion
of pearl, jasper, cornelian, agate, and many stones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
greater beauty and value! Such exquisite carvings,
such lovely mosaics, such labyrinths of inwrought
balustrades and porticos! Such tombs, so rich, so
beautiful, so great, that the tomb of Napoleon in Paris
is lost in comparison!</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was delighted beyond measure by a visit
to the tomb of the Empress Noor-Jehan, wife of the
Shah Jehan. Moore uses her romantic history in his
“Lalla Rookh,” for verily she was “The Light of the
Harem.” Shah Jehan, “Selim,” erected that marvellously
beautiful building, with its lofty dome, and
slender minarets, its inlaid jewels wherein the walls
are made to hold a copy, in Arabic, of the whole
Koran. Beautiful as Eastern songs represent Noor-Jehan
to be, the tomb in which she lies must surpass
her in whiteness and delicacy of outline. Never,
in harem of Cashmere, nor in garden of Mogul, were
there more delicious odors than those which still fill
the air about her tomb. No brighter, more various,
or more odorous flowers bloomed in Mahomet’s Paradise,
than now bewilder the visitor to that hallowed
spot. It was fortunate for Mr. Taylor that he had
seen the boasted palaces and temples of Europe and
Western Asia, before he visited that enchanted spot.
Dreams of Aladdin became literal there. In towers,
arches, domes, colonnades, ceilings of pearl and
precious stones, pillars wrought with the skilful
jeweller’s art, inlaid floors in which no crease appears,
in diamond-like foundations, and in the unity of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
unbroken sculptures, the temples of Agra and of its
suburbs, excel those of Venice and Florence, as the
exquisite and angelic echoes in the dome of Queen
Noor’s tomb excel, in length and sweetness, those of
the Baptistry at Pisa.</p>

<p>From Agra, he rode over the wide highway, one
hundred and fifteen miles, to Delhi, the former capital
of the Moguls, and which, at that time, boasted the
presence, in his palace, of Akbar II. There he was
treated with the same hospitality as he had been in
other cities, and kind-hearted residents guided him
about the streets of the modern city, and accompanied
him to the magnificent ruins in various quarters of the
plain whereon stood the old city. Pile on pile of
massive columns lay in ragged majesty about him, and
bewildered his senses with their unnumbered towers.
Ruins, ruins, ruins, as far as the eye can trace the
broken plain. Palaces, fortresses, temples, mosques,
harems, tombs, obelisks, and massive battlements lie
hurled together in undistinguished profusion, while
here and there the porch of some lofty building, or
some imposing arch, still breaks the line of the horizon.
One pillar stands in the plain, whose summit is two
hundred and forty feet above the ground. Near this
gigantic shaft are the ruins of the palace of Aladdin.
But the stone that cumber the plain, and the stable
platform, once the floor, do not suggest the palace of
diamonds, emeralds, pearls, gold, and ivory of which
we have read; and the beholder is tempted to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that there was a mistake of location, and that Agra
instead of Delhi, was the place after all. But Mr.
Taylor, whose time was limited, could not linger long,
nor hope to solve all the riddles which such an inexhaustible
antiquarian museum suggested, and after
visiting Hindoo temples, adorned with fascinating carvings
and unintelligible inscriptions, and tombs covering
the remains of known and unknown monarchs, he
hastened back to the modern city, with its wide Boulevard,
and made preparations to visit the Himalaya
Mountains.</p>

<p>He left that interesting city with great regret, for,
to the poet, it suggested a very attractive place for
fanciful dreams, and peaceful moralizing. Moore
incorporated in his poem a Persian inscription, which
was shown Mr. Taylor in the palace of Akbar II.:
“If there be an Elysium on earth, it is here, it is
here.” And it might have been such an Elysium but
for the dilapidated, dirty condition of the palace, in
which the motto was seen, which did not harmonize
with the sentiment, and may have robbed the whole
palace of its poetical attractions.</p>

</div>

<p>From Delhi Mr. Taylor travelled northward through
a country well subjugated, which, under English direction,
was made fertile and safe for travellers. His
way lay toward the sunnier resort of the invalids and
wealthy Europeans, which lay far up in the Himalaya
Mountains, where the snow never melted and where
the hot, miasmatic winds of the plains cannot follow
the fugitive. At Roorkee, while lying in his palanquin,
he caught his first glimpse of the Himalayas, and felt that
crushing sense of awful sublimity which fills the soul of
every new spectator. Towers that the arch of heaven
seems to rest upon, white and gleaming as the purest
pearl, rise one behind the other, until the farthest are lost
in the haze of intervening space. Titanic pillars of snow,
so grand, so mighty, so expressive of the most gigantic
forces known or imagined by man, how can language
convey their immensity? It is useless to attempt it.
For you may talk, and talk, of mountains and the glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sunsets that enamel them in roseate tints, yet
no one will shed tears or feel a tremor of awe. But
he who beholds them for the first time lets the tears
unnoticed fall, and trembles as if thrust suddenly into
the personal presence of the Almighty. Such a sense
of humility, of abject unworthiness, takes possession
of the beholder, that the soul labors heavily under the
oppressive load, and the body shrinks from a nearer
approach. There is nothing so powerful for driving
atheism or egotism out of a man as the near view of
the Himalayas or Andes or Rocky Mountains. The
noblest races of the world have been reared in the wild
regions of lofty mountains, and none so tenaciously
revere their Maker, or so willingly sacrifice themselves
for their friends or their God as the natives of the
mountain passes.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor approached the highest range as near as
the heights of Landowr, which is about sixty miles
from the snowy peaks of the loftiest range, and is itself
so high as to hold the snow the greater part of the
year. There he saw the gorgeous illumination of those
heavenly snow-fields, when the sun was setting and
when it seems as if a universe was in a blaze, while its
lurid glare shone full upon those stupendous monuments
of the earthquake’s titanic power. Mr. Taylor gazed
upon those masses of the purest white, as twilight
began to hide their outlines, and thought that, as he
said in one of his lectures, “within three hundred
miles of me are mightier mountains than these!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Having seen the mountains and checked his old
desire to stand on top of the highest one, he turned
about and started southward for Calcutta, taking the
first day’s journey on an elephant kindly loaned him
by a new-found friend. He journeyed thence in the
horse-carts of that time, via Meerut and Cawnpore, to
Lucknow, where he was entertained in a most royal
manner by the English officials. After examining that
great metropolis of the interior, he hurried on to
Benares and thence by quick relays to the great city
of Calcutta.</p>

<p>With a peculiar faculty for foreseeing the effect of
certain influences on human nature, Mr. Taylor foretold
the approaching mutiny. He saw that the English
treated the natives with habitual indignity. He saw
that three-quarters of the earnings of the people was
taken by the government. He saw that the English
were in a great minority. He saw that the Sepoy
regiments were good soldiers. He saw that influential
positions were held by dangerously powerful natives.
And he declared that a rebellion was not only possible,
but probable.</p>

<p>Four years later began that great rebellion among
the natives, which became one of the bloodiest and
cruelest contests known in the annals of history.
Chiefs and princes who received Mr. Taylor cordially
during his visit, were afterwards executed for treason.
Fortresses, temples, and cities, which he visited were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
shattered and torn by the shots of contending armies.
Oppression and aristocratic pride resulted, as it naturally
would, in horrid carnage and an impoverished
treasury. Mr. Taylor’s words of warning as they
appeared in America, were probably never read in
England, or if they were read, were scouted as the
fears of one who did not understand the “permanency
of a despotism.”</p>

<p>Although his stay was short in Calcutta, his description
of the people, the dwellings, the shipping, and
social customs was one of the most clear and complete
to be found in print. One who reads it sees the city,
the river, the verdant plains, and the sea spread out
before him, and becomes acquainted with the shop-keepers,
police, Parsees, Arabs, Hindoos, Chinese, and
Europeans, that made up the motley throngs. True to
his patriotic purpose, he gave the commerce of the
port such attention as the interests of our merchants
required.</p>

<p>From Calcutta he proceeded by an English steamer
to Penang on the coast of the Malay Peninsula. It is
a delightful locality, and is as beautiful in situation
and vegetation as its clove and nutmeg trees are fragrant.
There again he gratified his taste for climbing
a mountain, and spent nearly his whole time ascending
to the signal station on the highest peak of the peninsula.
It was the only place he visited in which he
left unseen the attractive nooks, grottos, waterfalls,
and jungles, and chose instead the less interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
experience. It was a source of regret to him afterward,
that he did not spend the few hours he had, in the
lowlands and on the mountain-sides rather than at their
tops. Every traveller who has visited Penang could
detect the error. Yet, Mr. Taylor set down in his
account of his visit more valuable information and a
more graphic outline of the landscape than any traveller
appears to have done, notwithstanding the beautiful
falls of Penang are visited by thousands yearly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus9">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NATIVE COTTAGES IN THE TROPICS.</p>
</div>

<p>Accompanying the steamer in its usual route, Mr.
Taylor stopped at Singapore, at the extreme southern
end of the peninsula. It was a new port at that time,
and was not so important as it afterwards became;
yet he found ten or fifteen thousand people there,
mostly dirty and repulsive Chinese. Mr. Taylor was
not pleased with the Chinese as a race, for two reasons.
First, he heard such reports of their barbarity, beastliness,
and dishonesty; second, they were an awkward,
unsymmetrical people, devoid of that physical beauty
which the artist admires and copies. He dwelt upon
the latter fact in his letters, and mentioned it in his
book. Neither Phidias, Polycrates, Raphael, or Angelo
would have selected a model from among these
creatures, and naturally enough the artistic taste of
Mr. Taylor was shocked by such natural deformities
as the Chinese were, when looked upon with reference
to the graceful and beautiful in the human form. It
is but just to the Chinese as a nation to say that,
according to the writer’s experience among them, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Coolies who emigrate to Singapore, Sydney, and California
are by no means a fair sample of the educated
and wealthy classes who remain at home and drive out
the least useful and least intelligent portion. If one
were to judge of the acquirements, ability, or physical
beauty of the Chinese nation exclusively by the poor
emigrants who cannot successfully compete with their
neighbors, and hence are compelled to go away from
home for success, he would be nearly as sadly misled
as one would be should he form his opinion of the
American people by the inmates of their jails and
poor-houses. There are many noble men and beautiful
women in the interior of China, whether regarded
mentally, morally, or physically. Mr. Taylor did not
see them, and like a faithful scribe he wrote down only
those things he saw, and knew to be true. The
Chinese whom he saw in the ports engaged in unloading
vessels, or doing like menial services, were not
beautiful, and he said so.</p>

<p>When Mr. Taylor arrived in Hong-Kong he was
received with the same kind hospitality which his very
countenance secured for him in every land. The
United States Commissioner, the Hon. Humphrey
Marshall, who happened to be at Macao, and whom
Mr. Taylor met there on crossing the bay from Hong-Kong,
offered to attach Mr. Taylor to his staff, for a
trip to the seat of war. The great rebellion in the
Kiangsu province, lying north-westerly from Shanghai,
had assumed such threatening proportions that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
emperor at Peking trembled on his throne. Exaggerated
accounts of the fiendish atrocities of the rebels,
and rumors of great battles and successful sieges had
reached the seaports, and even the peaceful American
merchants at Shanghai feared capture and death. In
view of all this, Mr. Taylor anticipated an exciting
experience. Together with the whole ship’s company,
he felt, when the United States steamer left Hong-Kong
for Shanghai, as if there was a measure of uncertainty
if he ever returned. But the reports had
been so much enlarged in their transmission to Hong-Kong,
that when they arrived at the port of Shanghai
they were delighted to find the place in no immediate
danger of attack from the Chinese. In order to show
the rebels that the Americans were neutral in all the
Chinese quarrels, the Commissioner undertook the
hazardous task of ascending the Yang-tse-kiang River
to the beleaguered town of Nanking. It seems to
have been a foolish undertaking, and viewed from
any diplomatic stand-point, to have been indirectly an
encouragement of the rebellion. It was not so intended,
however, and Mr. Taylor did not give his
opinion of the “good faith” which prompted the sending
of envoys to a local rebellion in the interior of a
“great and friendly nation.” But what good sense
could not do, the shoals and incompetency of the
native pilots did accomplish; and the Commissioner
who was going up the river to pat the rebels on the
back and ask them not to hurt their friends, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Americans, was compelled to return to Shanghai. It
would have been better for the United States if the
second undertaking had been equally unsuccessful;
but as Mr. Taylor had no share in it, it is of no further
importance here.</p>

<p>While at Shanghai he experienced the sensation of
being besieged without seeing an enemy. The frightened
people organized themselves into military companies
and drilled with the sailors. Breastworks were
thrown up and cannon placed ready for action. The
streets were patrolled and a guard kept over the provisions
and ammunition. Tales of approaching hosts
were freely circulated, and once the terrified populace
were informed by an intelligent refugee that the enemy
were within sight. Yet the days passed on; the
Chinese government began to show vitality, and the
great rebellion, with all its fearful butchery and refinement
of cruelty, was extinguished without the molestation
of the foreigners at Shanghai, and was overcome,
notwithstanding the encouraging assurance given the
rebels by the United States Commissioner that our
government was not disposed to interfere with their
outrages.</p>

<p>While in Shanghai Mr. Taylor wrote some admirable
articles upon the tea culture of China, and upon
the possible commerce with the Pacific coast of America,
which were published in New York and London.
He felt the throes of an earthquake while there, and
had some pleasant interviews with the educated classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of China. He saw the parade of the native soldiers,
and witnessed their grotesque religious ceremonies.
His observation was so close, and his generalization
usually so just, that until within a few years there has
been no book printed in America which gave so much
of the information desired by popular readers in so
little space as Taylor’s account of that visit.</p>

<p>Early in May Commodore Perry arrived at Shanghai,
prepared for the expedition which the United States
had ordered him to make to Japan, and Mr. Taylor’s
long-felt desire to embark on that enterprise was
gratified. He was compelled to enlist in the navy as
master’s mate, and subject himself and all that he
should write, to the orders of the navy department
and officers of the fleet. It seemed at first to be rather
humiliating terms, but after he had made the acquaintance
of the officers and learned the ways of a ship he
found it a very pleasant position. Thus, from one
calling to another, he turned with a readiness and a
success which were astonishing.</p>

<p>There was some opposition to Mr. Taylor’s request
to be taken into the United States service, but his persistency
and gentlemanly address not only overcame
the scruples of the Commodore, but soon made him a
general favorite. Commodore Perry, after his return
to the United States, mentioned the circumstances
connected with Mr. Taylor’s enlistment, and used the
following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On my arrival at Shanghai I found there Mr. Bayard
Taylor, who had a letter of introduction to me from an
esteemed friend in New York. He had been a long time,
as I understood, exceedingly anxious to join the squadron,
that he might visit Japan, which he could reach in no other
way.</p>

<p>“On presenting the letter referred to, he at once made a
request to accompany me; but to this application I strongly
objected, intimating to him the determination I had made at
the commencement of the cruise to admit no civilians, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
explaining how the few who were in the squadron had, by
signing the shipping articles, subjected themselves to all the
restraints and penalties of naval law; that there were no
suitable accommodations for him, and that should he join
the expedition he would be obliged to suffer, with the other
civilians, many discomforts and privations, and would moreover
be restricted, under a general order of the navy department,
from communicating any information to the public
prints or privately to his friends; that all the notes or general
observations made by him during the cruise would
belong to the government, and therefore must be deposited
with me. Notwithstanding this, however, with a full knowledge
of all the difficulties and inconveniences which would
attend his joining the squadron, he still urged his application.</p>

<p>“Being thus importuned, and withal very favorably
impressed with his gentlemanlike and unassuming manners,
I at last reluctantly consented, and he joined the mess of
Messrs. Heine and Brown on board the ‘Susquehanna.’
During the short time he remained in the squadron he gained
the respect and esteem of all, and by his habits of observation,
aided by his ready pen, became quite useful in preparing
notes descriptive of various incidents that transpired
during our first brief visit to Japan and the Islands. It
was the only service he could render, and it was afforded
cheerfully. These notes have been used in the preparation
of my report, and due credit has, I trust, been given to
him. Some of the incidents illustrative of the events mentioned
in my official communications were, with my consent,
written out by Mr. Taylor and sent home by him for publication
in the United States. These he has used in his late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
work. His original journals were honorably deposited in
my hands. His reports, like those of every other individual
detailed for the performance of a special duty, were of
course delivered to me, and became part of the official
records of the expedition.”</p>

</div>

<p>This tribute of friendship and respect, thus freely
bestowed by one holding the high rank of Commodore
Perry, gratified the friends of Mr. Taylor very much
at the time they were written, and will now be prized
by them as a testimonial from the highest and best
source.</p>

<p>On leaving the port of Shanghai the squadron of
the Commodore proceeded direct to the Loo-Choo
Islands, which were a group of thirty-six islands
lying to the south-west of Japan, and tributary to that
empire. On the 26th of May, 1853, the several
steamers and sailing vessels came to anchor in a harbor
of the Great Loo-Choo Island, but a few miles
from the capital of the kingdom. Immediately Mr.
Taylor’s services as a descriptive writer were brought
into requisition, and so proficient and industrious was
he, and he so much excelled the others with whom he
was associated, that the Commodore saw fit to entrust
to his quick eye and ready pen many of the most
important details of the expedition. His reports or
journals of the explorations were never published in
full, and as the government kept them from him Mr.
Taylor could not use them in his book of travels in
Japan and Loo-Choo. This is much to be regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
now, as the greatly condensed narrative which appeared
in his book does not give the reader a comprehensive
idea of Mr. Taylor’s capabilities. His newspaper
correspondence was always more readable and
full than were the pages of his book; for, between his
desire not to tire the reader nor impoverish the publisher,
he frequently culled and abridged too much.
What a wonderful volume would that be wherein
should be published in full Mr. Taylor’s descriptions
of the countries of Loo-Choo and Japan, without condensation
or abridgment. To illustrate this thought,
and to give a clear specimen of his style, we insert a
page from his diary of the 28th of May, 1853, reciting
his experience when out in a small boat in the harbor
of the Great Loo-Choo Island visiting the coral reef.
It was a very little incident, but we ask the reader to
notice how full of interesting information and beautiful
reference he made his account of it:</p>

<p>“The crew were Chinamen, wholly ignorant of the
use of oars, and our trip would have been of little
avail had not the sea been perfectly calm. With a little
trouble we succeeded in making them keep stroke,
and made for the coral reef, which separates the northern
from the lower channel. The tide was nearly out,
and the water was very shoal on all the approaches to
the reef. We found, however, a narrow channel winding
between the groves of mimic foliage, and landed
on the spongy rock, which rose about a foot above the
water. Here the little pools that seamed the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were alive with crabs, snails, star-fish, sea-prickles,
and numbers of small fish of the intensest blue color.
We found several handsome shells clinging to the coral.
But all our efforts to secure one of the fish failed.
The tide was ebbing so fast that we were obliged to
return for fear of grounding the boat. We hung for
some time over the coral banks, enraptured with the
beautiful forms and colors exhibited by this wonderful
vegetation of the sea. The coral grew in rounded
banks, with the clear, deep spaces of water between,
resembling, in miniature, ranges of hills covered with
autumnal forests. The loveliest tints of blue, violet,
pale-green, yellow, and white gleamed through the
waves. And all the varied forms of vegetable life were
grouped together along the edges of cliffs and precipices,
hanging over the chasms worn by currents below.
Through those paths and between the stems of
the coral groves, the blue fish shot hither and thither
like arrows of the purest lapis-lazuli: and others of a
dazzling emerald color, with tails and fins tipped with
gold, eluded our chase like the green bird in the
Arabian story. Far down below in the dusky depth
of the waters we saw now and then some large brown
fish hovering stealthily about the entrances to the coral
groves, as if lying in wait for their bright little inhabitants.
The water was so clear that the eye was
deceived as to its depths and we seemed now to rest on
the branching tops of some climbing forest, now to
hang suspended as in mid air between the crests of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
opposing ones. Of all the wonders of the sea, which
have furnished food for poetry and fable, this was assuredly
the most beautiful.”</p>

<p>That trait, which characterized Mr. Taylor, accounts
in a measure for the inclination of all persons who met
him to hold his companionship and acquaintance. As
Mr. Taylor’s esteemed friend, Mr. E. P. Whipple, of
Boston, once beautifully remarked of another, Mr.
Taylor was sought by men, “because they learned
more of the world and its beauties through his eyes
than through their own.” His services in giving an
accurate idea of the countries they explored were invaluable,
because it was not only necessary to visit
those countries and open their ports to commerce, but
it was also necessary to give to the American people
such a idea of the advantages and conveniences of
trade as to induce them to enter upon it. Nothing
could be clearer than his views of life in these islands,
nothing more complete than his enumeration of the
products, manufactures, and needs of the countries
they visited. The publication in full of all his notes
and observations as suggested to the Naval Department
by the officers of the Squadron at the time, would have
given our people a better understanding of the importance
of the commerce and the character of the people,
than any other report could do. However, the Commodore
used a great many pages of Mr. Taylor’s journal
while making his report to the United States Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was detailed to attend nearly every
important excursion, and was a most hearty and persevering
explorer. He pushed into the interior of an
unknown jungle, intent on finding new flowers, new
minerals, or new animals. He ascended every mountain
which was accessible, and ventured into every cave
that could be reached by boat or foot. The Great
Loo-Choo Island became familiar to him, and its flora
and fauna were indelibly catalogued in his mind, while
the varied views of mountain, vale, forest, bay, and
sea were engraved upon his memory. By his good
nature and kindly regard for the welfare of the Loo-Choo
natives when they met, he contributed not a
little toward the safety and success of the exploration
in that island.</p>

<p>From Loo-Choo the fleet sailed to the Bonin Islands,
where a harbor suitable for a depot of supplies was
found and land purchased by the Commodore for
government buildings should his choice of a harbor be
confirmed. The ships returned to Loo-Choo and proceeded
directly to the bay of Yeddo in Japan.</p>

<p>For two hundred years that important nation had
preserved its exclusiveness, and had become almost as
unknown to the western nations as an undiscovered
continent. Almost every commercial nation had, from
time to time, attempted to secure a footing for a trading-post
or a harbor for their vessels. In every
instance they had failed, and the civilized world had
looked upon Japan as a country sealed beyond hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of breaking. It must have appeared to every one,
including the Commodore himself, that the undertaking
in which he was engaged was an especially difficult
enterprise. How could he hope to succeed where
England, Portugal, Holland. Italy, and Russia had
failed? Yet he succeeded beyond anything the most
hopeful had desired; and as a result of his expedition
a mighty nation and a fertile country were restored to
the family of nations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PAGAN TEMPLE IN JAPAN.</p>
</div>

<p>In that expedition Mr. Taylor took a deep interest,
and with great enthusiasm wrote letters to his home
descriptive of Fusiyama, Kanagawa, and the scenery
around Yeddo Bay. During the long delay made by
the Japanese authorities, to impress the Commodore
with their dignity, he was engaged with eye and ear
and pen in the service of his country. With the devotion
which marked all his undertakings, he noted
everything which passed under his scrutiny, in order
that the Commodore might be informed of every
detail. Many travellers pass months at Yokohama,
Yeddo, or Nagasaki, making investigations and excursions,
without finding out so much of interest as Mr.
Taylor saw in a single day. That natural and acquired
acuteness of observation, and that intuitive comprehension
which made him so conspicuous, are well worthy
of study and imitation by all persons who are
ambitious to excel, whether engaged in travelling or
in any other occupation. So thoroughly had he disciplined
himself in the inspection of all that surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
him, that when he arrived in Japan, the ships,
the junks, the people, their dress, their customs, their
food, their language, the vegetation, the minerals, the
animals, the birds, the landscapes, the bays, the promontories,
the islands, the sea, the air, the sky, the
stars, the wind, and the sunlight were each and all
full of suggestions and valuable instruction. One
could not follow Mr. Taylor’s writings in the closing
years of his travels without becoming conscious of
ignorance and short-sightedness concerning the commonest
things of life. It made his readers feel, oftentimes,
when they discovered how much he had noticed
which they had overlooked, as boys feel when a playmate
finds a silver dollar on a spot which they have
passed and repassed without his good luck; with the
difference, however, that Mr. Taylor’s good fortune in
that respect was the result of hard work and careful
culture.</p>

<p>After the close of the preliminary negotiations, and
a hasty survey of the bay of Yeddo, the fleet departed
on a short cruise to Hong-Kong, in order to give the
Japanese emperor time to think over the propositions
which the United States Government had made to His
Majesty.</p>

<p>The trip to Hong-Kong, by way of the Loo-Choo
Islands, was without special incident, and on the 7th of
August he was again in the harbor which he had left
in the month of March. For five months he had
known what it was to be a seaman and made subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to the strict orders enforced on a man-of-war. It was
a fresh experience. He was keen enough to recognize
the merits and failings of naval discipline and naval
drill. He saw that many improvements might be
made in both. He thought, furthermore, that the
ships themselves might be constructed on a better
pattern. Hence, he boldly recommended changes
whenever the opportunity came for him to speak
through the public prints. He had become much
attached to the officers and men of his ship, and parted
with them at Hong-Kong with the feeling of sincere
regret. He had made it his home on board, and had
been so contented and so kindly treated that he felt
the pangs of homesickness as he shook hands and
went over the side for the last time.</p>

<p>Although he had enlisted for the usual term of
years, as the laws of the United States recognized no
shorter term, and ran the risk of being held to the
terms of his enlistment, yet there was a tacit understanding
between him and the Commodore that he
should be allowed to resign when the fleet returned to
Macao. Consequently, when he presented at that
port his resignation it was promptly accepted, and he
became a civilian again. He found it nearly as awkward
to be a landsman as he had at first to be a sailor,
and often looked out on the great men-of-war, as they
lay at anchor, with an indescribable yearning to tread
their decks.</p>

<p>From Macao, he made excursions to Hong-Kong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and Canton, finding friends that pleased him, and an
aristocratic snobbery that displeased him, in the former
place, and dirt, vice, and cheating in the latter,
which made him further disgusted with the Chinese
race. In Canton, as elsewhere, he spoke of them in
strong terms, condemning their importation into the
United States in a manner to please the bitterest
hater of the Celestials to be found on our Pacific
coast. Yet he visited the shops, practised the “pigeon
English,” visited the great temple of Honan,
tested the power of opium by smoking it himself,
made a tour into the country, interested himself in
the foreign factories and the local government, and
made the acquaintance of many enterprising foreign
merchants. But his aversion to the Chinese, doubtless
intensified by the wild rumors of barbarous deeds
then current on account of the rebellion, was not
abated after he had seen the great metropolis; and he
frankly admitted, in his letters and in his book, that
he was glad to get away from China.</p>

<p>At Canton, he took passage in a sailing vessel bound
for New York, that being his most direct and least
expensive route. He was anxious to return to the
United States, because he had been absent over two
years, and because of some financial arrangements
which he considered it important to make. He felt
also that if he should publish a record of his travels in
the form of books, the sooner they were issued after
his letters had appeared in the “Tribune,” the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
for the publishers and for himself. In this undertaking,
however, he was much delayed.</p>

<p>The ship in which he sailed, passed the Philippine
Islands and the coast of Java, and rounding the Cape
of Good Hope, stopped for water at the isle of St.
Helena. The body of the Emperor Napoleon had
been removed to Paris, but Mr. Taylor found it a very
interesting and romantic spot. He was as much
shocked, however, by the desecration of the spot by
the practical herd-keepers, as he was by the profanity
of the machine-rhymester who marred the grotto of
the poet Camoens at Macao with a doggerel composition.
Mr. Taylor felt the absurdity of such profanations,
as none but poetical natures can feel them.</p>

<p>From St. Helena, the voyage was not unusually
eventful, and after one hundred and one days at sea,
and with Mr. Taylor nearly that number of days
engaged in writing and correcting, they arrived in
New York on the 20th of December, 1853. His welcome
to New York and to his old home was one of the
most pleasant experiences of his life, and he often
mentioned it as being as exciting as the event of his
first return when he walked into the old homestead in
his German walking-suit.</p>

</div>

<p>Immediately upon his return from China, he entered
again the traces for hard and long literary work. He
had written poems, and snatches of poems, verses,
and couplets in his spare hours as a traveller, and his
note-book and guide-books were full of such impulsive
productions, written on the margin and on the
fly-leaves. Those scattered compositions he desired
to reduce to satisfactory and convenient shape for
publication. Some of them had been written on the
seas, some on the Nile, one in Spain, one in Constantinople,
one in Jerusalem, two in Gotha, and several in
railways and steamboats. The thought of publishing
them in the form of a book, was suggested to him by
one of his intimate friends in New York,—either
Mr. Stoddard or Mr. Ripley,—his intention having
been to publish them from time to time in some periodical,
in much the same manner as he had contributed
to the “Union Magazine,” some eight years before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
But he had sufficient appreciation of his own genius to
act promptly on such a suggestion of his friends, and
the first few weeks after his return were occupied with
that work, in addition to the work of arranging and
correcting his unpublished letters to the “Tribune.”
When he had completed the “Poems of the Orient,”
it was published by Ticknor &amp; Fields, of Boston, as
a companion volume to the “Rhymes of Travel,” and
“Book of Romances,” both of which were united in
one volume, in 1856, under the title of “Poems of
Home and Travel.” In the preparation of these
poems, he was greatly assisted by the kindly and discreet
criticism of his friend Stoddard, which he not
only acknowledged in the remarkable dedication
“From Mount Tmolus,” but mentioned it to his
relatives with expressions of thankfulness. The public
owe a debt to Mr. Stoddard for his generosity and
hospitality to Mr. Taylor, as well as for the beautiful
poems and truthful biographies which he has written.
A true man is a friendly critic, if a critic at all.
Such was Richard H. Stoddard.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was then called into a new work by a
curious public, who wished to see the man who had
wandered so far, and had seen so much of this great
earth. Hence he was repeatedly called upon to lecture
in various cities of the Eastern and Middle States. His
financial condition was not so prosperous as to preclude
the possibility of future needs, and as the
invitations to lecture were accompanied by very liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
offers in the way of remuneration, he accepted many
of them. It was, however, an uncongenial occupation.
Public speaking had never been recognized as
one of his great gifts, and the great masses who gather
on such occasions, gather more for amusement than
study. They wished to see how he appeared. The
ladies desired to know if he was handsome, well
dressed, and what was the color of his eyes and hair.
The men wished to see if he had become a foreigner
in speech or manner. The boys wanted to hear bear
stories, and the girls of wild giraffes and affectionate
gazelles. Not that the public desired to hear pure
nonsense; but that it wished its lessons very much
diluted. The polished essays of Mr. Taylor, with their
poetical language and refinement of expression, were
of little or no account, and a view of his portly physique,
and the right to say that they had seen him,
and heard him, satisfied the greater portion. To him,
such audiences were not agreeable. Whenever he
could find a friend like O’Brien or Stoddard, he
enjoyed reading his own productions; but to be set up
as a show, had in it no such satisfaction. Being also
very much engaged in preparing his books of travel,
and in writing for the “Tribune,” often writing on
the railway trains, and in hotels, he was weary, and
could not enter into the labor of public teaching with
the zest which might otherwise have been expected of
him. Yet, in point of numbers, and financial returns,
his tour, during the winter of 1854, was successful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and the harvest for the season of 1855 promised to be
still larger.</p>

<p>In addition to the work already mentioned, he had a
great number of private correspondents, whose letters
he answered with astonishing punctuality. Men in
Egypt, China, England, Germany, California, and the
United States, sent him letters of inquiry about the
best routes, and cheapest outfit for travel. To which
he replied as fully as he could, always remembering the
like favors done him when in the printing-office at
West Chester. There was a large number of friendly
acquaintances in many parts of the world who desired
to sustain a correspondence with him, and, often, his
desk at the “Tribune” had piled upon it as many
as fourscore letters, brought by a single mail. It
seems incredible when we think of the amount of
writing Mr. Taylor did during the years of 1854 and
1855.</p>

<p>Owing to the great amount of work which could
not be postponed, and the fact that the “Tribune” had
the moral right to his letters before he offered them for
sale in the form of a book, the last of his three
volumes of travel did not appear until August, 1855.</p>

<p>At one time, he entertained the idea of publishing
a book of songs, and consulted with his publisher concerning
the probable success of such a volume. But
having had his attention called to the fact that the
veriest trash answered the purpose of musical composers
fully as well as sterling poetry, he abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the idea. The thought was probably suggested to him
by the writings of Thomas Moore, whose “Lalla
Rookh” was frequently brought to mind while Mr.
Taylor was writing out the chapters of his book,
wherein he described his visit to Agra and Delhi in
India. The objections which he found to a volume of
songs, seemed equally applicable to single productions
which might be included in such a category, and he
not only suppressed many he had written, but cautiously
cut out verses in such as had been printed,
before he allowed them to be published again. He went
so far as to request that the song for which he obtained
the Jenny Lind prize in 1850, should be kept forever
out of print. Some of these are said to be among his
papers in Germany, where his body now lies, and the
writer sincerely wishes to see them all in print at a
day not very remote, together with the epistolary
poems and friendly sonnets which have been sent by
him to the distinguished scholars and poets who
enjoyed his friendship. It will take time to gather
them, but, when collected, will make the best of reading,
and will show the joyous, simple, sincere character
of the poet, as no amount of prose can do.</p>

<p>As early as October, 1854, Mr. Taylor conceived
the idea of building a summer residence near the old
homestead at Kennett. It may have been a purpose
entertained in his youth, for he often mentions, directly
and indirectly, in his early writings, the scenery and
the people about his home at Kennett. But in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
year the idea appears to have assumed the form of a
possibility, for he wrote to one of his old schoolmates,
who resided that autumn in Jersey City, saying that
he began to see his way for a house of his own at
Kennett. The letter set in circulation the report
that he was soon to be married; but he had kept
his own counsel so well, and held aloof so studiously
from the company of ladies, that none of
the gossips could possibly hint at the person of his
choice. This loyalty to his home and desire to
return to it like a weary bird to its nest, was a
beautiful trait of his character, and testifies strongly
to his natural goodness of heart. For it will be found
that the noblest men of all ages and professions have
loved the homes of their childhood, while the selfish,
narrow, barbarous, and mean, universally regard their
early associations with neglect or contempt.</p>

<p>A touching scene arises before the writer, as he
reaches this theme, and the tears will come to the eye
and cheek! Away in that German land sleeps the
son and brother. The romantic home at Kennett,
stands cosy, yet stately, among the winter-stricken
trees. Inside are the dear ones whom neither years,
nor honors, nor wanderings have induced him to forget—the
father and the mother in the mansion of their
son. There is the sister, whose feet, after years of
absence, tread again the paths of home. There the
visitor feels the gloom of a distant death. Windows
that flashed with light; drawing-rooms that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
made charming by the cheerful faces of the great and
good, are now suggestive of sadness and disaster.
The cold winds shake the dry vines, and cry around
its cornices. The loved ones are there,—waiting,
waiting for him to come home! He never disappointed
them before. Why comes he not? Why do
not his letters come with the mail?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane,</div>
<div class="verse">And fall thou drear December rain!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ah, we know the meaning now of those sad words.
For we have lived them too!</p>

<p>Ever looking forward to the time when he could
give his parents a more luxurious home, feeling most
keenly the rapid strides of time, as he looked upon
their whitening locks, unwilling to prosper alone, and
promoting ever the welfare of those he loved, he
strove with an unchangeable determination to accumulate
sufficient money to build a house near the old farm,
that should be a home for all, and a resting-place for
himself. To this, in part, was due his incessant work
through the years of 1854 and 1855. His books brought
him a considerable return; he received a reasonable
compensation as editor and lecturer, and he had lifted
the load of debt which the “Phœnixville Pioneer” had
bequeathed to him, but which no one believed he was
able to pay; and could look forward to a competency
and, perhaps, to wealth. Yet, in all his work, there
was a cheerfulness that seemed to give rest while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
work went on. He often indulged in fun, was ever
joking with his friends, and indulging in playful pranks
with his acquaintances. Usually, however, his facetiousness
was itself a method of self-discipline,—a
different kind of work. He used to visit his friends
whenever an evening could be spared from necessary
labor, and spend the hours in writing and exchanging
humorous burlesques, acrostics, sonnets, and parodies.
Sometimes he would “race” with his literary friends
in writing lines of poetry on a given subject, and
although, as he afterward acknowledged, he often came
in second best, yet he enjoyed the sport and the satisfaction
of the victor none the less. The same fun-loving,
mischievous, kind-hearted boy, who enjoyed
writing extravagant verses, and sending them to his
schoolmates, walked the streets of New York in 1855.
Time had given discretion, sorrow had given reserve;
but the fun bubbled out whenever the waters were
moved. His mirth was less ostentatious, but not less
hearty. Loving a bottle of beer, or wine, for the
sake of sociability, for in his younger days it was
universally considered a necessity, he never drank
to excess, nor was ever regarded by his companions as
an intemperate man. Envious simpletons have sometimes
accused him of intemperate habits during those
two years; but so well-known and frank was his life,
that it would have been then, as it certainly is now, a
waste of time to deny so absurd a statement. So-called
temperance men are often the most intemperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
people known in public life. As temperance, in fact,
consists of temperance in all things, as well as in the
use of intoxicating drinks, the real temperance people
of America will discourage alike the excess in the use
of stimulants, and that excess in the use of epithets
and misrepresentation, which, by the resulting reaction,
encourages the use of that which they wish to prohibit.
Intemperate speeches, like intemperate laws, and
intemperate drinking, are to be condemned and
avoided by all who believe the Highest Moral Standard
known to man. It is exceedingly intemperate to
circulate a falsehood about any person, and especially
of one of our own American family, who has done so
much for our nation, and “never wished harm to any
man.”</p>

<p>It had long been Mr. Taylor’s wish to take his
sisters and brother to Europe with him, in order that
they might enjoy those scenes which had pleased him
so much; and he had often mentioned, in his letters
to them from abroad, how much more he would enjoy
the advantages of travel, if they could be with him to
share in his pleasure. He was too generous to desire
the exclusive enjoyment of anything, and was especially
anxious that those related to him should reap the
benefits of all his labors. Hence, in the spring of 1856
(not without correspondence with one in Gotha, however),
he arranged his plans for another series of
excursions in Europe, and persuaded his sisters and
brother to accompany him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during those two years of labor that he made
the acquaintance of many of the distinguished literary
men of Massachusetts, and in one of those years—1855—he
secured the acquaintance and friendship of William
Makepeace Thackeray, who visited this country
then for the second time, and delivered his long-remembered
lectures on the “English Humorists of
the Eighteenth Century,” and “The Four Georges.”
So well known, and so much respected had Mr. Taylor
become, that he was sought by the great of both
continents, and when he departed for Europe, in the
spring of 1856, the kind wishes of thousands of
America’s representative men and women went with
him, and a welcome awaited him on the shores of
England from as many more.</p>

</div>

<p>Without bringing the living into a notoriety which
they certainly do not seek, and which might be unpleasant
for them, we cannot give an extended account
of that summer trip of Mr. Taylor and his friends in
the countries of Europe, already so familiar to him.
He devoted himself to the welfare of his companions,
and appeared to enjoy himself exceedingly. England
appeared brighter and more attractive than he supposed
it possible; and his pleasure in visiting historical
places was doubled by the fact that he had others to
appreciate and enjoy it with him. His sisters inherited
enough of that same instinctive comprehension of
vegetable nature, and enough of that fellowship with
kindred human nature, to regard the landscapes and
the people as he had regarded them, and made, as
he wrote to his friends in Philadelphia, wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
observing travellers. Other friends there were, who,
with his brother, made up a pleasant party, over which
Mr. Taylor was for the time the guide and protector.
He visited many places where he had never been before,
but he had studied his theme so closely during his previous
visits to Europe that even in strange places he felt
the gratification of one who had been there before,
and to whom each scene and relic was familiar. His
little party was often interrupted by the calls made
upon him to attend dinner-parties and select gatherings
of literary people; but he was not a neglectful
escort. His acquaintance with the men and women of
London whose names are known to all readers of English
literature, was promoted very much by the kindness
of Mr. Thackeray, who spared no pains to introduce
Mr. Taylor into that “charmed circle.” No one can
appreciate the pleasure there was in being introduced
to the authors of whom the world has said so much,
unless he has followed them like a friend through their
various volumes and learned to love them there.
Historians, essayists, biographers, poets, musical composers,
and scientific authors clasped his hand in
London and welcomed him to their homes and their
love. At last he felt that he had reached the heights
for which he had been striving, and was regarded as
an equal by those whose plane of thought he had so
long striven to reach. But that feeling had its reaction,
for he often examined himself and repeated to
himself his published poetry, and, as he described it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
himself, wondered what there could be in it worthy of
reproduction in Old England. His association with
the master-minds of England opened to him a wider
field of literature, and impressed him with the importance
of writing something loftier and more artistic
than anything he yet had undertaken. To that task
he turned all the forces of his nature; so that on leaving
England his friends noticed through all his vivacity
and unceasing attention a tendency to abstraction; as
though some important theme unspoken was uppermost
in his mind. He was searching for an ideal
which should not copy Tennyson, nor Wordsworth,
nor Browning, but should equal theirs in conception
and execution. He felt that irresistible yearning for
the highest poetical work, which is the surest indication
of genius. He was not egotistic, he was not foolishly
ambitious, but all his life he had been seeking
his place in the realms of poetry, feeling morally sure,
notwithstanding his own temporary misgivings, that
there was a great work for him to do.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the needs of the present crowded out the
dreams of the future, as they so often do in the lives
of others, and after a delightful summer in the lands he
loved, and a visit to those who were now dearer than
the most gorgeous landscapes, he determined upon a
trip to the frozen regions of Lapland. He undertook
that journey with evident reluctance. His communion
with the best minds of America and Europe had taught
him that of the works which he had published his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
poetry would live much longer than his travels. He
found that the place of a poet in the scale of human
merit was loftier than that of a journalistic traveller.
He had left home with a feeling of uncertainty about
his future course; but there was no longer hesitation
or doubt. He would follow out the routes laid out and
keep his promises to the newspapers and publishers,
and was determined to acquire an insight into the
Scandinavian language in view of an enterprise in the
way of translation, which, however, was never fully
matured nor undertaken. But his interest in travel
had lost its chiefest charms. It would not, could not,
satisfy his ambition. Some critics have accounted for
this lack of zeal by the nearness of his marriage, which
would take him from his wanderings. But the best
reason is the one he gave himself; viz., that he desired
to undertake some more permanent task—one that
should live when his travels were forgotten.</p>

<p>Hence, that indescribable lack which his readers
have so universally found in his books of travels published
after that date. He could not rid himself of the
burden, nor cease to ponder upon the subjects which
seemed worthy of a great poem.</p>

<p>Starting from Germany Dec. 1, 1856, and embarking
on a steamer which ran between Lubec and Stockholm,
he entered upon an undertaking more hazardous
and uncomfortable than anything he had ventured
upon before. But his experience taught him to fear
nothing and to move on so long as any other living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
being had lived on the same route. He had determined
to see a day without a sunrise and a night without
a sunset. To be able to state that fact in a book,
would, in itself, ensure its ready sale. Of this he
had been assured in New York by his friend Dr. E.
K. Kane, whose opinion was entitled to much consideration,
as the Doctor had been far more extensively
engaged in explorations, and had travelled many
thousand miles further than Mr. Taylor. Having
once decided to see that wonderful sight, nothing in
the way of privation could prevent the accomplishment
of his purpose.</p>

<p>The steamer from Lubec was a rough, uncouth, inconvenient
craft, and the sea-sick voyage which Mr. Taylor
and his friend made to Stockholm was not an
auspicious beginning for a tour so long and so dangerous.
But he relapsed into his old habit, acquired in
Asia, of regarding no delay with surprise or impatience,
and refusing to feel certain of anything until
he possessed it; and as neither carelessness, neglect,
lack of sleep or food was allowed to disturb him, he
made the company cheerful under the most distressing
circumstances.</p>

<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="700" height="410" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LAZARETTO CHRISTIANSAND.</p>
</div>

<p>On his arrival in Stockholm he could not speak a
word of the language, and had to depend mostly upon
his own common-sense in the selection of an outfit.
But his quick ear and tractile tongue soon caught up
words and phrases, the meaning of which he learned by
their effect when spoken, and when he started northward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
he was able to ask for nearly everything he
needed in the native language. Of his ride from town
to town, by diligence and by lumbering sleighs, along
the shores of the Bothnian Gulf, we cannot give any
extended account, and it can easily be found by any
reader who did not peruse it at the time of its publication.
But it answers our purpose to note how he
appeared and what he suffered. It was a terrible ride.
Day after day and night after night he pushed on,
losing many meals, and often without sleep, in a
temperature creeping downward far below zero, and
the sun sinking lower and lower on the southern horizon.
Frequently overturned in the snow, his beard
and hair a mass of solid ice, his eyelids frozen together,
his nose frost-bitten, his hands and feet momentarily
in danger of freezing, he kept heroically on his course,
allowing no rumors of unendurable cold or impassable
mountains, of snow ahead to drive him from his purpose.
With a wisdom that saved his life, he fell with
perfect <em>abandon</em> into the habits of Swedes, Finns, and
Lapps, as he in turn found himself in their country
and society, eating what they ate, and wearing such
skins as they wore, and following their habits, excepting
their dirt and their promiscuous arrangements for
sleeping. Around the gulf to Tornea, and thence to
Muoniovara, he sped northward with a haste which
astonished the natives, and a shortness of time which
has surprised many travellers who have followed him
on that difficult route. He made such acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and such friends on his way northward that they
wished him God-speed as he passed on, and welcomed
him in a royal manner on his return. On the borders
of Lapland he took his first lessons in reindeer-driving,
and a most amusing experience he had of it. He
could not at first balance himself in the narrow boat
which was built for snow navigation, and he was frequently
overturned in fathomless piles of snow; and
as he did not fully understand how to check the speed
of the animal, he flew like the wind over drifts, hollows,
and around corners with a most dangerous
speed. Many men would have given up the task,
after being frozen, kicked, bruised, and pulled half out
of joint by the first trial. But such experiences were
regarded by him as a joke, and laughing over past mishaps,
he tried again and again, until he could guide a
deer and balance himself in the narrow pulk as skilfully
as the Lapps themselves. He was not a traveller
who sought luxury and ease. He wished to sound all
the shoals and depths of local experiences. Some of
the trials were very hazardous, and make one’s hair
rise as he reads of them. Yet Mr. Taylor appears to
have put a blind trust in fate and went boldly on. In
all these visits and undertakings he forgot not his
Muse, and repeated “Afraja” and the “Arctic Lover”
when the snow blew too furiously or the cold was too
far below zero to engage in original composition.</p>

<p>With the thermometer varying from zero to forty
degrees below he traversed the wildest part of Lapland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which lies between the Bothnian Gulf and the
Northern Ocean.</p>

<p>At Kautockeino, far beyond the Arctic Circle, he
found friends, through the letter of a mutual acquaintance,
and recorded with his usual kindness of heart,
how good and how generous they were to him. There,
too, he saw the day without a sunrise, which he had
promised himself to see, and his description of the
white earth, the blue sky, the saffron and orange flushes
of the morning, and the crimson glow of the evening,
all combined in a few moments of time as the sun approached
the line of the horizon and sank again without
peeping over it, is one of the most charming and
graphic paragraphs to be found in literature. There,
too, he saw the moon wheel through her entire circuit,
without a rising and without a setting. There he
made sketches of the dwellings and the people which,
after so much practice, he was able to take in a very
accurate and artistic manner, and which served afterwards
for illustrations in the pages of a magazine.
There he met a Lapp by the name of “Lars,” and
meeting the name often afterwards, suggested the
name for that poem of “Lars,” now as popular in Norway
as in the United States. There, in that extreme
north, in the house of a native missionary, he found a
piano, and was half beside himself with joy when the
kind-hearted ministers wife played “Yankee Doodle.”
She had heard Ole Bull play it at Christiania, and
caught the tune in that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>His return to Stockholm was more tedious and dangerous
than his northward journey, for the weather was
colder and the storms more severe. But his reception
at the miserable huts along the route, where he had
stopped on his journey northward, was always so
hearty and friendly that he felt no longer in a strange
land. It was a repetition of his experience elsewhere.
He was loved at sight, and has not been forgotten to
this day by the humble friends he made. Nothing
shows the whole-souled manner in which he threw himself
into the feelings and habits of the people, better
than the expressions which he used in his letters concerning
the scenery. He felt so much like a Swede,
that he loved the landscapes with the devotion, of a
native. Notwithstanding he had used all the superlative
terms which our language furnished, in which to describe
the scenery of the tropics, yet there he went
further and declares with great enthusiasm, that the
South had no such beautiful scenery as the ice-bound
forests and mountains of Sweden. To him, when he
saw them, there were no landscapes to compare with
those before him. The transparent crystals, the purity
of the snow, the shape of the half-buried trees, the
boundless plains of white, and the gleams of acres of
diamonds when the frosty spirals greet the morning
sun, all possessed a charm beyond the attractions of
any other land, so long as he was their associate. He
became a Swede, and knew, when his experience was
over, just how a Swede lived and how he felt, what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
loved and what he enjoyed. Thus he came to a more
thorough understanding of the people, and had a better
appreciation of their literature, than any other traveller
known to the public prints.</p>

<p>On his return to Stockholm, February 14, he set
about the work of learning the language and literature
of the Swedes. For nearly three months he kept close
to his books and his practice in the gymnasium, and
although it seems almost impossible, it is said by his
associates that he could then read fluently any work to
be found in the Norse language.</p>

<p>He left Stockholm on the 6th of May, taking a
steamer for Copenhagen, from which place he purposed
to take a steamer for Germany. At Copenhagen he
met Hans Christian Andersen, the great Danish poet,
by whom Mr. Taylor was received most cordially.
Thus, one after another, the great men of the world
were added to the list of friends found by this son
of an humble American farmer. Andersen afterwards
sent Mr. Taylor copies of his poems and essays before
they were printed, and in many ways showed his regard
for the American poet. There Mr. Taylor met Prof.
Rafn, the archæologist, and Goldschmidt, the author of
the “The Jew,” and editor of a magazine.</p>

<p>Prof. Rafn, gave Mr. Taylor his initiation into the
beauties of Icelandic poetry, for the professor was an
earnest admirer of northern lore, and loved to converse
with any one who took an interest in it. Ho read some
of the verses which he especially admired, for Mr. Taylor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
criticism, and Mr. Taylor was so delighted with
them that he resolved to study the literature of Iceland
and at some time to visit the Island.</p>

<p>From Copenhagen Mr. Taylor hurried over to Germany
to look after his friends, and after a stay of a few
days hastened to London on business connected with
his books. He left London about the first of July,
after seeing his relatives depart for America, and
taking a steamer at Hull, sailed for Christiania in
Norway. The steamer stopped at Christiansand,
where the rugged, broken promontories loom up
so grandly over sea and bay. No harbor is more picturesque
than that of Christiansand, and no coast
more uneven. Perhaps the best description of the
coast from Christiansand to Apendal, given by Mr.
Taylor, is to be found in his poem of “Lars,”
wherein Lars and his Quaker wife sailed from Hull for
Apendal.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Arrangements had been made with his intimate German
friend, whom he first met in Egypt, and in whom
Mr. Taylor then took such a deep interest, to meet him
at the hotel in Christiania, from which place they purposed
to start on a trip overland through Norway to
Drontheim, and from that city by steamer to the
northern capes of Norway, where the summer sun did
not rise or set. Another “sacred triad” was formed—one
German and two Americans—equally fortunate
and equally pleasant with the former triad in Egypt.</p>

<p>Their course lay through the rugged and drear landscape
of Southern Norway, and at the time they made
their journey the sky was overcast and the air loaded
with moisture, giving every bleak cliff a bleaker appearance,
and every barren waste a gloomier aspect. With
all his poetical nature, Mr. Taylor did not find much
to admire on his way to Drontheim. His sympathy
was aroused for the poor farmers who dwell in such a
solitude as seemed to envelop the land, and he was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
when the gleams of the river announced their approach
to Drontheim.</p>

<p>From Drontheim they sailed by the Hammerfest line
on the 18th of July, following the coast so noted for
its fantastic crags and startling cliffs. The coast
scenery from Drontheim to Hammerfest is unquestionably
the most broken and grand in the world. Its
black towers, enormous arches, gigantic peaks, and
resounding caverns excel anything in the way of sombre
grandeur that travellers elsewhere have described.</p>

<p>As they approached the Arctic Circle the mountains
became capped with snow, and chilly winds blew off
the land, and the days became so long that the evening
and the morning succeeded each other with but an
intervening twilight. Gradually the midnights grew
brighter until, as they proceeded round the North Cape,
the sun shone in all its splendor throughout the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>After several days spent in visiting the small fishing
villages along the northern coast, they again turned
southward and disembarked at Drontheim, from which
place they took passage to Bergen.</p>

<p>From Bergen they travelled on horseback and by
boats, over the interior lakes to Christiania, and from
that city through the interior of Wermeland and Delecarlia
to Stockholm, where they arrived about the
middle of September. There Mr. Taylor remained
long enough to call on many of the friends whom he
had made during the previous winter, and then the
“triad” departed for Berlin and Gotha.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Taylor was married in October following his
return from Norway and Sweden, to Marie Hansen,
whose father had already gained a world-wide reputation
as an astronomer through his works on Physical
Astronomy, and was then winning renown for his “Tables
de la Lune,” for which he was given a prize by the
English Government, as a public benefactor. He was
a man of remarkable mathematical genius, universally
respected, and the founder of the Erfurt Observatory
near Gotha. It was a family of scholars which received
Mr. Taylor as a son and brother, and a fortunate
alliance for the world of letters. It would be interesting
to our readers, no doubt, to know all about the
ceremony, the guests, the letters, and the relatives.
But that which at some future day may be elevated to
the plane of history, would be mere gossip now; and
could only serve, for the present, to bring more vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
before his loved ones living, the greatness and reality
of their loss.</p>

<p>Not even such an event as his marriage was allowed
to interfere with his work. His travels in the North
had been in a great measure described in detail from
day to day, as he stopped for food and rest, and when
he left Stockholm for Germany, a large pile of manuscript
had accumulated, which needed correction and
arrangement before being sent to his publishers in New
York. To this he applied himself closely, and a
month after his marriage, was in London making the
closing arrangements for the appearance of his book
on “Northern Travel,” published by G. P. Putnam
&amp; Sons, and containing a condensed account of his
winter and summer in the Norse countries.</p>

<p>Immediately after despatching the manuscript for
the book, together with several letters for the press, he
made his preparations for a winter’s sojourn in Greece.
He had purposed to take a trip from St. Petersburg
across the continent of Asia, through Siberia to Kamtschatka,
and returning through Persia and by the shores
of the Black Sea. But it appears that neither Mr.
Greeley, nor Mr. Putnam, nor his German relatives
approved of the undertaking, which, together with
some unsatisfactory financial details, caused him to
abandon the snows of Siberia for the sunshine of Attica.</p>

<p>This arrangement must have been a far more pleasant
one for him, as Mrs. Taylor and other friends could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
accompany him to Athens, and as that land was so
connected with the richest themes for poets and scholars.
Many of Byron’s poems had been favorites with
Mr. Taylor from his boyhood, and especially familiar
were those passages relating to Greece; for the reading-books
in use by American scholars, in his school-days,
contained, very wisely, several selections from
Byron’s patriotic poems relating to Greece. To this
was added an appreciation of “Childe Harold,” gained
by visiting the Italian scenery where Byron lived during
those years of his voluntary exile.</p>

<p>The party left Gotha in the early part of December,
1857, and going down the Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic
Gulf, visited the ancient town of Spolato, where
the ruins of the Emperor Diocletian’s palaces are still
imposing and beautiful. Without losing the steamer,
which put in at all the small ports along the route, they
skirted the southern shores of the Gulf of Corinth;
and, after crossing the Isthmus near Ancient Corinth,
sailed direct for Piræus.</p>

<p>To a man of Mr. Taylor’s mental capacity and disposition,
the country afforded the means for the highest
enjoyment. Men may be as unsentimental as a beast,
and as regardless of ancient greatness as a savage,
and yet their lives will be influenced more or less by a
sojourn in old Greece. Later philosophers declare,
and attempt to prove it on scientific principles, that
the typography of the country, added to the influences
of the climate, produced the great minds of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Greece. If so, which may be wholly or partially true,
then the same hills and the same valleys, combined with
the same climate, must influence the mental characteristics
of those who live there now. If, however, as is
too frequently the fact to make a clear case of the
philosophers’ claims, men do reside under the Acropolis
and in the Academian groves wholly unaffected by the
scenery, certain it is that to a poet whose whole ambition
and only joy was found in a determination to follow
the lead of Homer, Simonides, and Tyrtæus, it was an
ecstasy of mental satisfaction to feel the influence of
the surrounding associations. Even Mr. Taylor feared
that his name as a poet would lead people to consider
his descriptions to be somewhat colored by the imagination,
and labored hard to avoid the imputation. He,
with great candor and truth, claimed that men are as
great as they were in the days of Demosthenes and
Aristides, although the community to which they belonged
has moved farther west. He did not believe
that all the great and noble and good belonged to the
past. He recognized the great fact that dead men
have better reputations than living ones, and that the
longer a man lies in his grave the greater seem his virtues,
and the less the number and magnitude of his
faults, <i>i. e.</i> if he is not forgotten altogether. So,
Mr. Taylor inserted such thoughts in his letters and
conversation, for the sake of seasoning his enthusiasm,
which he feared was too active. But it was as useless
for him as it was for Byron, and as it has been for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
American poets who visited those ancient groves, to
keep above or outside the subtle and powerful influences
which Greece puts forth. Oh! land of heroes,
patriots, poets, philosophers, orators, and musicians!
Oh, land of republics and birthplace of fleets! How
like a visit to the homes of Solon, Plato, Socrates, and
Polycrates it is to walk thy fields, and how like a flight
to the homes of the gods, to dream through thy moonlit
nights!</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor made the most of his winter in Greece,
and visited every place of ancient renown which was
accessible to travellers. He scarcely waited for the
dawn of his first day in Athens before he hastened to
the Acropolis, and admired its marvels and historical
suggestions. At the Propylæa, which crowns the
mountain with beauty and majesty, where all the
destructive inventions of two thousand years have
failed to annihilate the monument which Phidias and
Calicrates erected to their genius, Mr. Taylor was
overwhelmed with emotions, and gazed with wonder at
the chaste sculpture which adorns the most graceful
structure ever made of marble, and in silent awe contemplated
the pillars, cornices, tablets, pavements, and
broken ornaments with which he was surrounded.
Where was the Coliseum he had praised so much when
a boy? Where were the cathedrals, palaces, and castles
he had regarded as so sublime? Everything he had
seen sank into insignificance beside the ponderous yet
exquisitely beautiful pile before him. He was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
affected, that when he spoke he whispered, as if in the
presence of Jupiter, and his eyes grew moist as he
tried to compass the grandeur of the lofty Parthenon
and Propylæa. This language will seem extravagant
to the reader who has not felt such sensations. The
writer, who makes no pretensions of being a poet
either in letters or by nature, has been so filled with
the unspeakable grandeur of some of the scenes from
the heights of the Alps, Himalayas, and Rocky Mountains,
as to find himself, to his own surprise, shedding
copious streams of tears. It is a sensation unknown
to common experience, and our language has no adequate
terms with which to describe it. Such a feeling,
beyond a doubt, was that which reigned in his sensitive
nature when he stood in the porch of the Parthenon.
To him, those marvels of art produced the impression
which nothing but the mightiest mountain-peaks could
awaken in others. It must have been grand to possess
such a nature; and it is grand to follow him through
his letters and books. There was the crowning point
of all his travel. It had been reserved until near the
end of his wanderings, and a fitting climax it was.
The poet and traveller amid the ruins of Athens! He
spent many happy hours amid the crumbling evidences
of Athenian greatness. Temples uncounted lay half-buried
in the broken soil. Those of Demeter, Hercules,
Apollo, Aphrodite, Hephæstus, Theseus, Dioscuri,
could be traced in the earth, or confronted the
antiquarian with majestic porches; while the Odeon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Gymnasium, Museum, Aglaurium, Lyceum, Prytanæum,
Erechtheum, Propylæa, and Parthenon, can easily
be reconstructed in the imagination of any student of
Greek history with the aid of their wonderful ruins.
And when those colossal edifices stand forth in their
beauty, it is but a step to the sublimest dreams, wherein
Socrates, Anaxagoras, Pericles, Eschylus, Sophocles,
Ictinus, Mnesicles, and their noble cotemporaries,
walked through the colonnades, along the payed streets,
and among the verdant, classic groves which bordered
on the Ilissus. The walls of Athens, extending from
Hymettus to the distant sea, the city crowded with the
wealth of the commercial world, and the fields as
verdant and fruitful as now.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor often remarked that he should never
have been a successful traveller had he not been a poet;
and it might be added that persons, in whom the
power to recall the past through the debris of the
present is wholly lacking, had better not travel at all.
There are hills in Pennsylvania, or New Hampshire,
far more picturesque than the Acropolis, and on them
might be erected a tolerably accurate copy of the Propylæa,
Erechtheum, and Parthenon as they now stand,
and the curious might visit them to observe the beauty
of the architecture and remark the foolishness of those
who constructed them. Unconnected with any history,
and the originals unheard of, they would be nothing
but mere monuments to folly, with all their symmetry.
Take away from Athens the records of its grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
humanity; the stories of its achievements; the tales
concerning the wonders of its genius; the renown of
its arms; the memories of its misfortunes; and all
the life, the spirit, that shines through its fragments,
as the soul beams through the eye of a loved face,
would be extinguished, and no great good could come
from seeing them.</p>

<p>We mention these things, not to excuse Mr. Taylor
for his strong assertions concerning the effect these
ruins had upon him, but to give to the student a clearer
insight into the nature and life of the poet, Bayard
Taylor. From Athens, after visiting the king and
queen, Mr. Taylor made excursions into the interior,
and to the Island of Crete, visiting, in his various tours,
Candia, Rhithymnos, Corinth, Leuetra, Mycenæ, Arcadia,
Sparta, Parnassus, Platea, Thermopylæ, and
various other fields, mountains, and ruins connected
with ancient Greece. At Crete he was most graciously
welcomed by the Turkish governor, and was treated
with the most generous hospitality by the people and
officials, throughout a somewhat lengthy journey about
the island. It was there that he met the American
consul who was going to start the commerce of Crete
by bringing in a cargo of rum to exchange for the
products of the island, and who was so startled by
Mr. Taylor’s frankly avowed hope, that the ship would
be wrecked before the curse of drunkenness was added
to the other Cretan vices. Mr. Taylor gave a somewhat
different version of the affair, not changing however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
its exposition of his sentiments on the subject of
drunkenness. But it is to be supposed, that the consul,
who was so severely rebuked, would have the
best reason for remembering it, and, as his version
throws no discredit on Mr. Taylor, and varies in no
important particular from that given by Mr. Taylor,
we give the consul the benefit of the story.</p>

<p>At Corinth he had a startling experience in an earthquake,
feeling the earth rise and fall with that sickening
movement, creating a nausea like the sea-sickness
of a whole voyage concentrated into a few minutes, and
saw the stone walls of the house crumbling and splitting
about him. He arrived after the greatest shock
had passed, or he would have seen whole streets of
buildings thrown down, for the village was half in
ruins when he reached the place. Near Corinth he
saw the plain whereon were celebrated the Isthmian
games and repeated sections of Schiller’s poem, “The
Gods of Greece.”</p>

<p>At Argolis he saw the gateway of Mycenæ, guarded
by the celebrated stone lions, and tried to connect
Agamemnon and Orestes with the landscapes.</p>

<p>At Sparta he trod the sward above the buried
palaces, and having no poets’ names to rhyme with
Lycurgus and Leonidas, he hurried on to scenes less
suggestive of mere physical endurance and bloody
encounters.</p>

<p>In Mania, within the boundaries of ancient Sparta,
he was delighted to find the descendants of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Greeks, whose blood was not diluted by that of Turks,
Slavs, Italians, and Egyptians. He found there what
no other part of Greece visited by him could boast,
the Greek face and form such as Phidias, Praxiteles,
and Lysippus portrayed in their immortal sculptures.
At Olympia he saw the home of Xenophon, and the
foundations of that temple of Olympus from whence
the Greek chronology was taken, near which were
celebrated the great Olympian Games, around which
were once those sacred groves so often mentioned in
Greek poetry and tragedy, and where the most artistic
work of Phidias stood,—the ivory statue of Jupiter.</p>

<p>At Thebes he recalled the deeds of Pindar, Epaminondas,
and the heroes of the Trojan War.</p>

<p>At Delphi he looked over the forests that clothe the
lofty Parnassus, gazed into the rocky cleft from which
the priestesses received their communications, and saw
the sites of temples used for gardens, and blocks from
the sacred shrines used for cellar walls.</p>

<p>At Thermopylæ he marked the spot where the heroes
fought and the narrow gorge where they fell, with feelings
of respect and pride. He said that the story of
such deeds should never be allowed to die.</p>

<p>At “Aulis” he saw where Jason launched his ships
to sail in search of the Golden Fleece, and repeated a
part of the Argonautic story in modern Greek.</p>

<p>On all these journeys Mr. Taylor displayed the same
fearless, adventurous spirit, and was frequently in
danger. By fortunate accidents he was prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
from falling into the hands of brigands, and returned
to Athens, after his prolonged journeys, in
good health, and with the accounts of his journeys
nearly complete in his pocket.</p>

<p>When he left Athens in the spring for Constantinople,
he had become acquainted with all parts of ancient
Greece, and was able to give to his readers a fund of
valuable information concerning the country and its
products, the people and their industries. He had
kept up that triple life which characterized all his later
travels in Europe and Asia, and saw everything modern
in the way of manners, races, products, commerce,
government, and everything that remained of the
ancient days in the shape of monuments, temples, or
ruins, together with those undefinable yet real suggestions
which come to the poet, and to him alone.</p>

</div>

<p>After a short stay in Constantinople, the party,
under the guidance of Mr. Taylor, went by steamer to
the mouth of the Danube, and thence up that river to
his new home at Gotha. Mr. Taylor had set his heart
on building a residence in the oak woodland near his
old home at Kennett, and now that he was married,
his anxiety to see it completed led him to think
seriously of returning at once to the United States.
Having, however, a vague fear that he might not again
visit Europe as a traveller, and being unwilling to
leave the largest empire in the world unvisited, he
resolved to make a hasty trip to Moscow and St.
Petersburg. It was not a tour which he would personally
enjoy as he had his stay in Greece, yet it was
needed to make complete his knowledge of Europe.
Hence he hastened away from Gotha, and, taking
Cracow, the salt mines of Wieliczka and Warsaw in
his route, arrived at Moscow about the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
June. Having seen the wonders of that ancient capital
of Russia, he went by railroad direct to St. Petersburg.
There he was much interested in the massive
structures of granite and marble which stand over the
land which was once an impassable marsh, and pondered,
with feelings of great wonder, upon the control
which man exercises over nature. The grand squares,
the wide Boulevards, the ponderous bridges, the extensive
palaces, the solid cathedral, and the broad
quays and docks, give an impression of grandeur in
simplicity, which no other city possesses. The great
capital has none of that air of gayety and ostentation
which one notices in Paris and London; but is stately,
dignified, grand. Everything is done on a large scale,
and the buildings, halls, streets, and parades, are alike
suggestive of might, and a strong will. The city is
Peter the Great in stone. It conveys the impression
to the traveller, of strength without coarseness, and of
beauty without display.</p>

<p>Little did Mr. Taylor expect, when he bade those
extensive, massive palaces adieu, that he should return
to that city, in a few years, as the official representative
of a powerful nation. Probably the idea of being
again in those galleries of art, was as remote from his
calculations as was the idea of being minister of the
United States at the court of the German Empire,
when he walked reverently along the Unter-den-Linden
at Berlin for the first time, trying to get a peep at
the distant carriage of the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>From St. Petersburg, he took the inland route for
Prussia, passing through the Baltic provinces, and
studying the habits and appearance of the people.
His return to Gotha, from Russia, was regarded by
himself, and by his friends, as the close of his wanderings,
and, with a sigh of relief, he laid down his pen,
and declared that he wished for nothing more than to
“settle down in a home of his own near the old farm
in the States.” A few weeks later, and he was receiving
the congratulations of his friends in New York,
and had taken his place at the familiar desk in the
office of the New York “Tribune.”</p>

<p>Then began another season of closest and severest
mental labor. Rest, during his waking hours, seemed
impossible, and even the hours which he spent at the
Literary Club and at his rooms, were more or less connected
with his work. Literature was his work, and
literature was his play. He had become enamored of
Goethe and Schiller, and already conceived the idea of
giving to the world a translation of their best works.
He had the “Argument” of the “Poet’s Journal” in
his mind, and every visit to the scenes of his first love,
in the companionship of the second, served to urge
him to complete and publish it.</p>

<p>He had become one of the noted men of America,
and the calls, to lecture, to write, to visit, to attend
dinners, and write editorials, were incessant and persistent.</p>

<p>The construction of his house took much of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
attention, and he ransacked his collections of sketches,
and photographs of villas, palaces, and cottages in the
Old World, to find such a plan as he could be satisfied
to adopt. It was no child’s play with him to construct
the building wherein to make his home. He had
thought of the matter from boyhood, and that clump
of oaks on the highland, about a mile to the westward
of Kennett Square, and within a short distance of the
old homestead, had ever been his choice. His years
of wanderings had sharpened his desire for a permanent
home, and, with characteristic care and thoroughness,
he investigated his plans and means. He had
owned the land for five years, and had gloried in being
the owner of American soil, without which one can
hardly claim to be an American. He attended to all
the details of rooms, closets, stairways, windows, brick,
stone, cornices, roof, tower, with caution and deliberation;
and when he contracted with the masons, carpenters,
and gardeners, he knew just what was needed, and
told to each what was expected of them. There was
a ceremony attendant on breaking the ground, a procession,
and a box of records deposited in the foundation,
when the corner-stone was laid, and such a house-warming
when it was dedicated October 18 and 19,
1860, as Americans seldom enjoy. There was feasting,
singing, original poetry, original plays, and one
of the happiest, merriest companies ever gathered
under a hospitable roof.</p>

<p>But while the building was being slowly and carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
constructed, with its thick walls of stone and
brick, Mr. Taylor, was engaged no less in his editorial
tasks. The summer after his return from Europe, he
made several excursions in an editorial capacity, one
of which took him again to California. The great
changes in the city of San Francisco, and in the
appearance of the entire State, so far as he visited it,
were marvellous, and were as marvellously pictured to
the minds of his readers. His time was much occupied
in delivering lectures in the various cities of the State;
but he used his disciplined eyes and ears to such advantage
that he gave in his book the most full and accurate
account of California,—its agriculture, its institutions,
its lakes, its mountains, its great trees, its mines,
its enterprises, and its people,—to be found in any
work of the kind now in print. It is astonishing how
much he could put into a paragraph, without giving
it a crowded appearance!</p>

<p>His time, from the day he returned from California,
was mostly engaged in delivering lectures and writing
letters. He was not rich, and he was generous. He
had a house to build, and to pay for. Furniture must
be had, and his accumulated fortune was not large
enough for all. Hence he travelled, and he delivered
lectures, notwithstanding the disagreeable experiences
which he was compelled to endure. He yearned to be
at the translation of “Faust”; but necessity drove
him to talk of travel and biography. He had a
home, for “it is home where the heart is,” and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
longed to be in it. But necessity sent him forth with
a rude hand, and held him aloof from his own. Oh!
that is the saddest experience in human life! To feel
called to a certain work; to know that there is one
task for which one is peculiarly fitted by nature and
by discipline; to see before him still the beckoning
forms which have hovered in the glory of every setting
sun, since earliest childhood; to feel that one’s
productions, which might be valuable, are unfinished,
and hardly shaped, before they are forced into the hands
of conscienceless critics, is one of the most miserable
conditions in life. This condition, which has worn
out so many men of genius, and which has, with
tyrannical coldness, compelled authors to fence up their
own literary highway, or die, was not felt by Mr.
Taylor in that degree that it was by some of his cotemporaries,—and
by many since his time. But he felt it
often enough and keenly enough to sympathize with
others, and most forcibly expressed their feelings
in his “Picture of Saint John.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But soon assailed my home the need of gold,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The miserable wants that plague and fret,</div>
<div class="verse">Repeated ever, battling with our hold</div>
<div class="verse">On all immortal aims, lest, overbold</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In arrogance of gift, we dare forget</div>
<div class="verse">The balanced curse; ah, me! that finest powers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Must stoop to menial services, and set</div>
<div class="verse">Their growth below the unlaborious flowers.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet manfully did he toil, neglecting sleep and food,
eager to teach, determined to earn honestly the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
which he was to receive. He desired to have a home
free from debt, to which he could invite his friends,
and feel that his hospitality could be safely and honestly
extended to all those whom he loved and honored.
So he toiled, as men seldom toil, using every moment on
railway and steamboat, to write out those pages which
his engagements prevented him from doing at home.
As a consequence, his health began to decline, and oft-repeated
warnings of friends and of physicians, which
he tried to keep from the knowledge of his relatives,
drove him from the lucrative field of lecturing.</p>

<p>With his face set, steadfastly set, toward the tombs of
Goethe and of Schiller, seeing the great obligation he
was under, to a Providence which had so richly endowed
him, to give to man some masterpiece, he turned
at once toward his loved Germany, when he felt the
necessity of a change of home, and a change of work.</p>

<p>But the exciting events immediately preceding the
War of the Great Rebellion, so stirred his patriotic
soul, that he turned his thought and work into patriotic
channels, and worked on until late in the spring of
1861. His words in the newspapers, in the magazines,
and on the rostrum, were ringing trumpet-calls
to the defence of the Republic. The Chinese say that
“there are words which are deeds.” That could be
said of those Mr. Taylor uttered. His public addresses
were enthusiastic appeals for the salvation of
the nation, and his poems had in them the boldest
spirit of patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>In his poem, “Through Baltimore,” written in April,
1861, he described the approach of the Union soldiers
to Baltimore, the onset of the mob, and closed the
story with these words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“No, never! By that outrage black,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">A solemn oath we swore,</div>
<div class="verse">To bring the Keystone’s thousands back,</div>
<div class="verse">Strike down the dastards who attack,</div>
<div class="verse">And leave a red and fiery track</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Through Baltimore!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bow down, in haste, thy guilty head!</div>
<div class="verse indent4">God’s wrath is swift and sore:</div>
<div class="verse">The sky with gathering bolts is red,—</div>
<div class="verse">Cleanse from thy skirts the slaughter shed,</div>
<div class="verse">Or make thyself an ashen bed,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">O Baltimore!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the 30th of April, 1861, he wrote an address to the
American people, the last verse of which expressed the
sentiment of the whole poem and we insert it here:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Slow to resolve, be swift to do!</div>
<div class="verse">Teach ye the False how fight the True!</div>
<div class="verse">How bucklered Perfidy shall feel</div>
<div class="verse">In her black heart the Patriot’s steel;</div>
<div class="verse">How sure the bolt that Justice wings;</div>
<div class="verse">How weak the arm a traitor brings;</div>
<div class="verse">How mighty they, who steadfast stand</div>
<div class="verse">For Freedom’s Flag and Freedom’s Land!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the poem which created the greatest enthusiasm
at the time of its publication, and which is still a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
touchingly inspiring selection, was written at about
the same time as the “Address to the American People,”
possibly ten days later, and it was given the title
of “Scott and the Veteran.” To fully appreciate the
power of those verses, one needs to recall the hesitation,
and the excitement, and the uncertainty which the
nation felt in that dark hour. In a time like that, a
few clear, unmistakable words work wonders with a
people. Well does the writer recall the electrical effect
of that poem in 1861, when read at a patriotic gathering
of the yeomen, in a valley of the Berkshire
Hills, in Western Massachusetts. The lines were not
so polished, nor the words so choice as many other
verses which Mr. Taylor had written; but they seem
to come again as they were then recited, and awaken
memories of mountain glens, and “mountain boys”;
of camps and battles, of fields of cotton made fields
of carnage; of loved faces looking skyward, cold and
still; of a nation saved, redeemed, renewed. The
three closing verses we have never forgotten.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In June, the necessity of rest, and the desire to
obtain it in such a way as to get pleasure and advantage
from his release, influenced him to take a trip to
his wife’s old home, and to spend a month at the country
residence of a friend which was situated on slopes of
the Thuringian Forest, not far from Weimar and Gotha.
It was a lovely spot, and a pretty cottage, and about
him were numberless reminders of Schiller and Goethe,
with whose names he was so creditably to connect his
own. Whether he gained the rest he needed or not,
is a question still undecided. Certainly he did not
gain as much as he would, had he left Goethe’s
“Faust,” and his own new volume of poems behind
him, and chafed much less under his great suspense
concerning the results of the American War. He
ran up the American flag to the ridge-pole of his cottage,
and walked about uneasily, awaiting news from
home. He talked of the war with his neighbors and
visitors, wrote about it to whomsoever of his friends
he thought might not understand the merits of the
contest, and, at last, about the 1st of August, hastily
broke up his cosy housekeeping, and returned to
America.</p>

<p>Appointed as Secretary of Legation.—Life in St. Petersburg.—Literary

</div>

<p>In the summer of 1862, Mr. Taylor accepted the
appointment as Secretary of Legation at St. Petersburg,
Russia, for which he was indebted to his life-long
friend, the Hon. George H. Boker, of Philadelphia,
whose services to the nation as Minister Plenipotentiary,
as well as his gifts as an author, have made his
name familiar to the reading public of America.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the official duties connected
with his office especially pleased Mr. Taylor, and it is
believed by his friends that he regarded them in about
the same light that Hawthorne looked upon his office.
It was an honorable and responsible position, especially
so during 1862 and 1863, when the United States
was laboring so earnestly, and finally so successfully,
to gain the friendship of Russia, and Mr. Taylor appreciated
it. Certainly the American Legation at St.
Petersburg was never more popular at the Court of the
Emperor than during the term of Mr. Taylor’s sojourn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Whatever the credit which is due to the Minister during
his stay, it is no disparagement to say that Mr.
Taylor made many warm friends in St. Petersburg,
who remember him, and weep for his untimely death.
When the duties of the Legation devolved entirely upon
him, as <i lang="fr">charge d’affairs</i>, he was treated with the greatest
consideration, and for a time the court circles
believed that the President of the United States would
promote him to the office of Ambassador, as appeared
to them to be his due.</p>

<p>But Mr. Taylor was in no wise an office-seeker, and
cared more for the honor of writing a good book than
for any office in the gift of the President. So the
autumn, winter, and spring which Mr. Taylor spent in
St. Petersburg were devoted to his studies of literature,
so far as he could do so without neglecting his
duties. He made several excursions into the interior
of Russia, and made himself acquainted with the
language and writings of Russian authors. Work!
work! work! Incessantly writing, reading, or observing!
Such was his life in St. Petersburg. His
envious critics have said that his genius all lay in the
ability to do hard work. But does not successful hard
work exhibit genius in its greatest strength? Some
may, in one dash, make themselves famous. Authors
may concentrate all their power in a single leap, and
reach the heights of fame at one bound. But of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
men you seldom hear a second success. Their single
work is all that they do well. Not so with Mr. Taylor.
The publication of one book only left the way
clear for a better successor. His Muse was not uncertain,
his genius was not spasmodic. Two of his
poems, written in Russia, namely, “The Neva,” and
“A Thousand Years,” were afterwards translated into
Russian, and received the hearty encomiums of the
cultured nobility. His story of “Beauty and the
Beast,” located at Novgorod, to which place Mr. Taylor
made an excursion while connected with the American
Legation at St. Petersburg, has also been translated
into the Russian language, together with other
selections from his writings, showing that his literary
renown did not suffer by his residence in Russia.</p>

<p>But his highest ambition in life was to publish a
worthy translation of Goethe and Schiller, together with
a biography of both. This had been his purpose from
the time he first visited Weimar and Gotha. To this
his other labors became gradually subordinated.</p>

<p>How he came to turn his attention to prose fiction
can be accounted for on the supposition that he adopted
that character for the purpose of testing his own
powers, and securing an income which would enable
him to prosecute his studies and investigations relating
to Goethe and Schiller. He did not hope to be a leading
novelist, and the public placed a much higher estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
on his novels than he did. The desire he had to
immortalize his old home, the urgent appeals of friends,
and the advice of acquaintances, pressed him into a
field which he confessed in his lectures was uncongenial.
Yet he had no more reason to be ashamed of
“Hannah Thurston,” “John Godfrey’s Fortunes,” and
the “Story of Kennett,” brought out soon after his
return from Russia, than he had thirteen or fourteen
years before to be ashamed of the Jenny Lind prize-song,
or the poem delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa
Society of Harvard College.</p>

<p>After leaving Russia, he soon returned to the United
States, and, with lecturing and writing, occupied the
time until again called abroad by a desire to see some
localities visited by Goethe, and describe the great
Paris Exhibition of 1867. Then followed those years
of work at home, and travel abroad and at home, as
his duties as author, editor, and correspondent demanded.
In 1866 appeared his poem, “Picture of
St. John,” which was immediately translated into
Italian by an admirer in Florence. His poem, “The
Ballad of Abraham Lincoln,” appeared in 1869,
“Goethe’s Faust,” in 1871, “The Masque of the
Gods,” in 1872, “Lars, a Pastoral of Norway,” in
1873, “The Prophet, a Tragedy,” in 1874, and “Home
Pastorals, Ballads, and Lyrics,” in 1875.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1874, Mr. Taylor visited Iceland as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the correspondent of the New York “Tribune.” He
had visited Egypt, and was to return to America
after a short stay in Europe, but the news of the
Millennial Celebration, which was to take place on the
island August 2d and 3d, called a large number of
people to the festivities, and it was fitting that a great
American newspaper should be represented. But
neither the people of Iceland, nor the editors of the
“Tribune,” nor Mr. Taylor, had any idea, when he
set out, that his visit would be magnified into a recognition
of the event by the people of the United
States. His knowledge of the Danish language, and
his study of the Icelandic tongue, according to his
plan laid in Copenhagen eighteen years before, when
on his way to the Northern Ocean, made him peculiarly
fitted for the position in which he was, by a conjunction
of unforeseen circumstances, unexpectedly thrown.
But his genius was as spontaneous as it was persevering;
for in a few moments of time, amid confusion,
and conversation in which he took part, he wrote the
poem, “America to Iceland,” which, when read to the
Icelanders in their own language, on the occasion of
their largest gathering, created the greatest enthusiasm.
One verse ran thus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Hail, mother-land of Skalds and heroes,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">By love of freedom hither hurled;</div>
<div class="verse">Fire in their hearts as in their mountains,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And strength like thine to shake the world!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Taylor’s printed description of the scenery,
people, government, and geysers of Iceland, is a standard
work on that almost unknown island, and is written
in a vein readable and refined. As it shows rather
the fruit of a cultured life than the processes of culture,
its contents require no extended notice in a work like
this.</p>

<p>In the winter (February) of 1878, President Hayes
offered Mr. Taylor the vacant mission at Berlin, expressing,
at the same time, his conviction that there
was no other American living who could so nobly and
creditably fill the position of Minister of the United
States to the German Empire. Mr. Taylor’s fame
as a German scholar; his relation, by marriage, to the
German people; his popularity at home and in Germany;
and his creditable performance of his duties in
a like position at St. Petersburg, made it peculiarly
fitting that he should represent the American people in
that official capacity.</p>

<p>It was an office unsought by Mr. Taylor, but, nevertheless,
it was most cheerfully accepted, as it would
give him an opportunity to prosecute his studies of the
life of Goethe and the life of Schiller, which could not
be so well secured in any other way.</p>

<p>The announcement of the appointment was hailed by
the people of the United States with the liveliest
demonstrations of approval. Neither the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of Mr. Bancroft or Mr. Motley received such universal
approbation. All the newspapers, with no known exception,
declared it to be one of the wisest appointments
made by the administration. All parties applauded
at home, and the leading journals of Europe
mentioned it with words of praise.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was overwhelmed with congratulations,
and President Hayes received letters from almost every
State and city in the Republic, thanking him for making
such a creditable selection, and commending his
wisdom. Mr. Taylor was feasted, and “toasted” by
his commercial and literary friends with an enthusiasm
and liberality never known before on such an occasion.
Ovation after ovation was given, and his departure
in April from New York was witnessed by hosts of
his friends.</p>

<p>His welcome at Berlin was scarcely less hearty.
Authors and editors received him with earnest expressions
of satisfaction. The Crown Prince, Prince Bismarck,
and even the Emperor and Empress greeted
him with most unusual marks of respect. With a
world looking to him for yet greater things, but
thankful for the noble deeds of the past, Mr. Taylor
set up a home at Berlin in which he hoped to finish
those books on Goethe and Schiller, to which he had
already given some of the best years of his life. At
last there was rest. Honored by his nation, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a literary position above the darts of envy, with a
gifted wife and lovely daughter, he entered his home
in Berlin, saying, “Here I can work in peace. Here
we shall be very happy.”</p>

<p>Who can foretell the future; or, in the words of
Goethe’s “Mephistopheles,”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Who knows how yet the dice may fall?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That drear December, of which he had written so
much, and which ever seemed to him the saddest of all
the year, found him dangerously ill with the dropsy.
He tried to be quiet, as the physician directed. He
tried to resume the old Arabic resignation which had
so often served him in the place of substantial accomplishment.
But the habit of years, the overmastering
desire to labor, the “passion for work” which made
his life successful, held sway over him still.</p>

<p>His nation had commissioned him to serve at the
Court of Berlin. There was a call for him at the Legation.
He could not refuse to go, if he had the
strength to move. So he rises from his bed, and goes
forth to fulfil the desires of his people. It is his last
work. His beloved America receives his dying attention!
The next day (Dec. 19, 1878), just after the
messenger had left at his door the first printed copy
of his new work, “Deukalion,” the poet, traveller,
scholar, patriot, brother, husband, and father, left
his work unfinished to enter upon the Eternal Rest.</p>

<p>He had long suffered from a mild form of a kidney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
disease, but neither he nor his physicians attached any
importance to that complaint. On the day that he
died, he arose from his bed, dressed, and received
visitors. Feeling tired, at noon, he concluded to lie
down and rest. He slept for a short time, quietly, but
on awakening, his mind wandered, and his symptoms
became at once alarming. Dr. Lowe Kalbe, who was
Mr. Taylor’s physician, and an old friend, was with
him, together with Mrs. Taylor and their daughter
Lillian. But he sank rapidly, and at four o’clock
in the afternoon, peacefully passed away.</p>

<p>How like a voice from a living Past came to us his
own sad lines, when they said to us in sadness,—“Bayard
Taylor is dead!”</p>

<p>Seldom has the death of a single individual wounded
the hearts of so many personal friends. Men have
attained to greater renown, and have been, perhaps,
as extensively known by their writings and their fame;
but rare, indeed, can be found in history the name of
one who had so many intimate companions. The
number of those who claimed the right to be his friends
is beyond computation, at this time,—within a few
weeks after his death,—but it includes many of the
most noted men of the world.</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson, the poet-laureate of England,
was an acquaintance and correspondent of Mr. Taylor’s,
their first meeting being at Mr. Tennyson’s house,
Farringford, on the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>William Makepeace Thackeray was one of Mr. Taylor’s
warmest literary friends, from the time when they
met at a dinner of the Century Club, in New York, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
1856, until Mr. Thackeray’s death, in 1863. The
friendship was kept alive by Mr. Thackeray’s daughters,
who first met Mr. Taylor in London, in 1858, and
who at that time most hospitably entertained him,
together with his brother and sisters.</p>

<p>Robert Browning often invited Mr. Taylor to join
his select company in London, their acquaintance having
begun in 1851; and Barry Cornwall (Bryan Waller
Procter), treated Mr. Taylor with the greatest kindness
and hospitality, writing frequently, until he died,
in 1874, to inquire after Mr. Taylor’s progress in the
translation of “Faust.”</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle and John Bright were numbered
among his correspondents, although it so happened
that he met them but seldom.</p>

<p>Among the leaders of English literature whose friendship
he enjoyed, there is a very large circle of literary
and scientific men who knew Mr. Taylor through their
frequent meetings on social and formal occasions, and
who were well acquainted with Mr. Taylor’s books.
From many of these there came the expressions of
great grief, when the fact of Mr. Taylor’s death was
announced in London.</p>

<p>In Germany he was quite as well known as their
native poets of his time, and he secured the respect
and love of nearly every distinguished literary man
and woman in that Empire. One of the sweetest
friendships of his life was with that most fascinating
descriptive writer, Berthold Auerbach, whose “Villa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
on the Rhine” was given to the American public in
1869, by Mr. Taylor. These two authors were like
twin brothers in their authorship, and some of Auerbach’s
letters, descriptive of European scenes and
people, could be inserted in Mr. Taylor’s books, verbatim,
and the interpolation be scarcely detected.
Their regard for each other equalled their gifts, and
one of the sincerest mourners at the funeral of Mr.
Taylor, was that gifted scholar, Berthold Auerbach.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor’s first acquaintance with Alexander von
Humboldt, was in 1856, when Mr. Taylor called upon
the great naturalist at his home in Berlin. The reading
of Humboldt’s works had been of great benefit to Mr.
Taylor, as a correspondent, and he so informed the
Professor, at which he seemed much pleased. Humboldt
took great pains to secure all of Mr. Taylor’s
letters, as they appeared from time to time in the
“Tribune,” and most warmly praised him for the remarkable
manner in which he pictured the scenes he
visited. The acquaintance was frequently renewed, and
when Humboldt died, in 1859, Mr. Taylor is said to
have been numbered among the mourning friends, by
those in charge of the funeral, although he was in the
United States at the time. For years the public
in America was led to believe that Humboldt ridiculed
Mr. Taylor’s writings, although what could have been
the motive of the one who originated the falsehood it
is hard to conjecture.</p>

<p>With the French authors he did not have a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
extended personal acquaintance, although he had met
many of them, and frequently exchanged books with
Victor Hugo and Guillaume Lejean.</p>

<p>His acquaintances in America included nearly every
living author of his generation, and he numbered
among his intimate friends the most gifted men in the
land. Nearest to him, perhaps, stood Richard H. Stoddard,
of New York, and his talented wife, Elizabeth
Barstow Stoddard. Both were born in Massachusetts,
and have frequently spent the summer months at Mrs.
Stoddard’s old home in Mattapoisett, in company with
Mr. Taylor and his family. A jolly household it was,
when the Taylors and the Stoddards united their families,
as they frequently did, in the city, or on the seashore.
One of Mr. Stoddard’s many books, viz., the
Life of Humboldt, contains an introduction by Mr.
Taylor, and many of Mr. Taylor’s poems were submitted
to Mr. and Mrs. Stoddard for their criticism,
before he published them. With them, and with Mr.
George Ripley, he appears to have maintained the most
confidential relations to the day of his death.</p>

<p>Many of his early friends have preceded him to that
“silent shore,” and many tears did he shed over their
graves. Nathaniel P. Willis, his earliest friend in the
great city, who encouraged him and introduced him
into a literary life, died at his home of “Idlewild,” in
1867. Washington Irving, who in his old ago was
earnest enough to leave his home at “Sunnyside” and
go to New York, to urge Mr. Taylor to persevere in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
his poetical undertakings, and whose advice assisted
Mr. Taylor so much in his various trips into Spain,
died in 1873.</p>

<p>Dr. E. K. Kane, who aided Mr. Taylor in laying
out his route through Norway, and whose letters of
introduction and commendation to George Peabody,
the great banker, and to other influential men in England,
opened the way for Mr. Taylor into the best
society of that capital, did not live to meet Mr. Taylor
on his return from Norway, as had been arranged, but
died alone, at Havana, in 1857.</p>

<p>William Cullen Bryant, whose master-pieces were
Mr. Taylor’s study, and whose personal friendship was
so much valued, that Mr. Taylor visited the Berkshire
Hills of Massachusetts, wherein the “Thanatopsis”
had its birth, to note “if the scenes would have the
same influence on a stranger, that they appeared to
have had on a native,”—he whose counsel and companionship
had, through many years, been counted
among the “richest boons of life,” died a few months
before Mr. Taylor, and the shadow had not passed
from Mr. Taylor’s brow, and his poetical tribute to
Bryant was hardly in print, before he was called “to
join the caravan that moves to that mysterious realm.”</p>

<p>Fitz-Greene Halleck, who used to caution the young
poet, and who took pride in every new achievement of
the traveller, died in 1867.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley, the editor of the Tribune, whose
friendship was of the most steady and substantial kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and for whom Mr. Taylor felt the respect due to a
parent, expired in 1872. It was when writing of Mr.
Greeley’s death that Mr. Taylor gave the following
sketch of their friendship:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My own intercourse with him, though often interrupted
by absence or divergence of labor, was frank at the start,
and grew closer and more precious with every year. In all
my experience of men, I have never found one whose primitive
impulses revealed themselves with such marvellous
purity and sincerity. His nature often seemed to me as
crystal-clear as that of a child. In my younger and more
sensitive days, he often gave me a transient wound; but
such wounds healed without a scar, and I always found, afterward,
that they came from the lance of a physician, not from
the knife of an enemy.</p>

<p>“I first saw Mr. Greeley in June, 1844, when I was a boy
of nineteen. I applied to him for an engagement to write
letters to the ‘Tribune’ from Germany. His reply was
terse enough. ‘No descriptive letters!’ he said; ‘I am
sick of them. When you have been there long enough to
know something, send to me, and, if there is anything in
your letters, I will publish them.’ I waited nearly a year,
and then sent seventeen letters, which were published.
They were shallow enough, I suspect; but what might they
not have been without his warning?</p>

<p>“Toward the end of 1847, while I was engaged in the
unfortunate enterprise of trying to establish a weekly paper
at Phœnixville, Penn., I wrote him—foreseeing the failure
of my hopes—asking his assistance in procuring literary
work in New York. He advised me (as I suspect he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
advised thousands of young men), to stay in the country.
But I <em>had</em> stayed in the country, and a year too long; so
another month found me in New York, in his office, with my
story of disappointment, and my repeated request for his
favorable influence. ‘I think you are mistaken,’ he said;
‘but I will bear you in mind, if I hear of any chance.’</p>

<p>“Six weeks afterward, to my great surprise (for I supposed
he had quite forgotten me), he sent for me and offered
me a place on the ‘Tribune.’ I worked hard and incessantly
during the summer of 1848, hearing never a word of
commendation or encouragement; but one day in October
he suddenly came to my desk, laid his hand on my shoulder,
and said, ‘You have been faithful; but now you need rest.
Take a week’s holiday, and go into New England.’ I
obeyed, and found, on my return, that he had ordered my
salary to be increased.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hiram Powers, the American sculptor, who so
heartily welcomed the young pedestrian to Florence,
Italy, and who through the years which followed,
showed a most kindly spirit, making Taylor his guest
and confidant, passed away from the contemplation of
beautiful earthly forms to figures angelic, in 1873.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kirkland, on whose magazine, in 1848, he
began to regain the literary prestige which the failure
of the “Phœnixville Pioneer” took from him, and who,
with Halleck, so kindly opened the way for him to
teach a school in New York, to repair his shattered
fortunes, was gone, together with a large number of
their mutual acquaintances in the literary circles of
New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the ranks were so sadly depleted, there
are still living a most brilliant company of his early
literary friends.</p>

<p>John G. Whittier, who still resides in Amesbury,
his patriotism unabated, his Quaker simplicity unchanged,
and his fame as a poet increasing, as civilization
and freedom extend. To him Mr. Taylor dedicated
his poem of “Lars,” and in it thus mentioned
his first meeting with Whittier:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Though many years my heart goes back,</div>
<div class="verse">Through checkered years of loss and gain,</div>
<div class="verse">To the fair landmark on its track,</div>
<div class="verse">When first, upon the Merrimack,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the cottage roof I heard the autumn rain.</div>
<div class="verse">A hand that welcomed and that cheered,</div>
<div class="verse">To one unknown didst thou extend;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou gavest hope to song that feared;</div>
<div class="verse">But now by Time and Faith endeared,</div>
<div class="verse">I claim the right to call the Poet, Friend!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus did a Quaker write of a Quaker in dedicating a
Quaker poem.</p>

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow lives and sings as
in those days when Taylor read the story of “Hyperion”
and the poetry of “Voices of the Night,” and resolved
to visit Boppart and to be a poet. Mr. Longfellow
had a name to be envied in the annals of literature,
when the man of whom we write was a rollicking,
mischievious boy. Yet Taylor has appeared on the
stage of life, has enacted a very important part, and
is gone. His friend and benefactor remains, loved
and honored in the old Washington mansion at
Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>That marvellously versatile and skilful man, Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, though born long before
Taylor, still walks the halls of learning, and, while
enjoying the deserved rewards of “The Autocrat of
the Breakfast-Table,” “Old Ironsides,” and the numerous
other publications in the shape of essays, poems,
and medical text-books, was not ashamed to be called
the friend of Mr. Taylor, and recalls his association
with him in the most affectionate terms.</p>

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, the poet and essayist, who,
like Mr. Holmes, enjoys a world-wide reputation as a
man of letters and thoughts, moves among men as of
yore, while his younger acquaintance has passed on
before.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, upon whose brilliant literary
career Mr. Taylor said he often “gazed with bewilderment,”
but who was among his much-loved literary
friends, adorns the court of Spain, as the Minister of
the United States, while the life of his colleague which
began much later, has ceased to move his hands to
friendly grasps, and his lips to living words.</p>

<p>Richard H. Dana, Sr., the “eldest poet,” has been
dead but a few days. Amos Bronson Alcott retains
his home in Concord, appearing much as he did when
George Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and Theodore Parker
were with him on the “Dial,” which the Taylors read
in Pennsylvania; but he who came to their homes so
short a time ago, will cross their thresholds no more.</p>

<p>Thomas Bailey Aldrich remains, and writes on for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the love of it, while his friend and early companion in
New York,—Taylor, who praised his “Babie Bell” and
“Daisie’s Necklace,” has laid down his pen forever, and
will sit down with him no more at social boards.</p>

<p>George William Curtis, who was born the year
before Mr. Taylor, and whose travels, books, and correspondence
for the New York “Tribune,” gave him
such a similar experience, now stands at the front in
American oratory, and looks forward to wider fields of
usefulness, as though life had just begun. As a representative
American in literature and in political
influence, he has lost in Mr. Taylor an earnest and
efficient comrade.</p>

<p>Edwin P. Whipple still lives on Beacon Hill in
Boston, and, together with his brilliant wife, recalls the
face and words of Taylor with the affectionate regard
of appreciative minds and loving hearts.</p>

<p>James T. Fields, of Boston, comes and goes, an
authority on literary excellence, and an attractive
expounder and biographer, while the boy who came to
him long, long ago, to learn if Ticknor &amp; Fields
would publish a little poem, has grown into manhood,
into fame, and passed on to the Hereafter. The friendship
of many years,—so beautiful a sight between
publisher and poet,—which the pressure and uncertainty
of business could not sever or decrease, is
broken, ah! so rudely, by the hand of death.</p>

<p>The Hon. George H. Boker, of Philadelphia, still
counts his useful years; while the boy whose poems he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
purchased, and whose ambition he directed, has seen a
long and eventful life, using but a part of the time in
which his benefactor has lived. Of him Mr. Taylor
wrote in 1855:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“You were the mate of my poetic spring;</div>
<div class="verse">To you its buds, of little worth, concealed</div>
<div class="verse">More than the summer years have since revealed,</div>
<div class="verse">Or doubtful autumn from the stem shall fling.</div>
<div class="verse">But here they are, the buds, the blossoms blown,</div>
<div class="verse">Or rich or scant the wreath is at your feet;</div>
<div class="verse">And though it were the freshest ever grown,</div>
<div class="verse">To you its incense could not be more sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">Since with it goes a love to match your own,</div>
<div class="verse">A heart, dear friend, that never falsely beat.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>George H. Boker, Jr., and Mrs. Taylor are, by the
terms of Mr. Taylor’s will, his literary executors.</p>

<p>The Hon. J. R. Chandler still resides in the same
old home at Philadelphia, into which the trembling
youth came for the loan of fifty dollars with which to
see Europe on foot. After a long and honorable life
he sees no act more creditable than the simple-hearted
generosity which he displayed toward that ambitious
stripling.</p>

<p>His brother, J. Howard Taylor, M.D., and his cousin,
Franklin Taylor, M.D., are both at their official posts
of honor in Philadelphia, while the sisters and parents
survive, still in that haze of doubt which precedes the
hard realization that Bayard is dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitelaw Reid may search long before he supplies
to the “Tribune’s” readers all the characteristics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Mr. Taylor’s writings; the literati of Philadelphia,
New York, and Boston, will long wait for the congenial

<p>Some portions of Bayard Taylor’s life have been
but lightly touched upon in the previous chapters,
because the writer felt that if mentioned in their
chronological order, he would be compelled to repeat
them when he should reach this chapter. In fact, the
history of Taylor’s translation of “Faust,” which we
propose here to outline, so far as we have been able to
learn it, necessarily includes the whole life of Mr.
Taylor, from his first visit to Germany to the day
when his mortal body gave way under its accumulated
load of work. “Faust” was intimately interwoven with
all the threads of his life; and whenever Messrs.
Houghton, Osgood &amp; Co. publish another edition of
Taylor’s translation, they could not better please and
instruct the public than by prefacing it with a synopsis
of Mr. Taylor’s life, wherein “Faust” was his inspiration
and guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that when he began the study of the
German language at Heidelberg, one of the books used
by him contained a selection from the First Part of
Goethe’s “Faust.” His instructors and companions there
were delighted with Goethe’s works, and, with pride,
mentioned him as Germany’s greatest man. Meeting
him, as it did, on the very threshold of the language,
at a time when there was a romance about the country,
and a fascination in the language which only youthful
ambition could give, he was ambitious to know
more about the master-mind, and sought those works
which contained the requisite information.</p>

<p>At Frankfort, he found the works of Goethe and
Schiller, and was fortunately a member of a household
where those authors were admired and often
quoted. He was told, as he afterwards declared, that
if he knew enough of German to read Goethe and
Schiller, it was all that he would need to know of
the language. How much that remark included he
did not at the time comprehend, and declared, when
his translation was in print, that he did not feel sure
that he was able to read all of Goethe as Goethe
intended it should be read, and that there were very
few Germans who understood the wonderful figures
and metaphors found in Goethe’s “Faust.” Being of an
ambitious temperament, which would not be satisfied
with any half-performed task, but which, nevertheless,
aimed at the highest achievements, he conceived
the idea, as early as 1850, of translating into English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the greatest work of Goethe. He could not at that
time comprehend how vast an undertaking he had
assumed. It required something more than a mere
knowledge of words to be able to translate accurately
and fully; and it was no light task for a person to
master the common meaning of all the words and
compounds which Goethe so recklessly used.</p>

<p>But when it became necessary not only to be able to
give the meaning of each word by substituting in its
stead one of another language, but also to give the
sense and shades of meaning which the words in
combination convey to a reader of the original, then
the task became formidable. But that was not all.
As Goethe, like every great genius, had many eccentricities,
as he drew many of his illustrations from
events in his own experience and scenes which he had
visited, it was necessary to a full understanding of the
great theme, to study Goethe’s characteristics, habits
of thought, education, and experience.</p>

<p>In short, if one were to translate Goethe, he must be
like Goethe in experience and mental composition.
He must know what Goethe knew; must look upon
man and his complicated life as Goethe looked upon it
in his time and circumstances. To the work of education
and self-discipline Mr. Taylor applied himself
most assiduously.</p>

<p>Twice, when some new difficulty presented itself
which he had not foreseen, he became discouraged and
resolved to give up the enterprise. Once was when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the appearance of Rev. Charles T. Brooks’ translation
seemed to forestall him in his hope for a profitable sale
of the book; and once when he saw with unusual
clearness the great difficulty of obtaining words in the
English language which should not only express the
meaning, but do so in acceptable rhyme.</p>

<p>But those discouraging facts were soon surmounted
or forgotten in the great passion of his literary life
and the study of the language, manners, and beliefs
of the German people was not abandoned.</p>

<p>He found in the first volume many references to the
superstitions of the German people, and he set about
learning the history of witches, fairies, sprites, and
the Devil, as known to German literature. This, in
itself, is no small task. He then encountered what he
thought was, perhaps, a kind of burlesque on the
government and its laws, and to feel sure that it was
so or was not so, he studied the history of the German
principalities, especially of Weimar, where Goethe
resided.</p>

<p>He found many illustrations from the landscapes
of Italy, Switzerland, Greece and Germany, and it
became necessary not only to visit those countries, but
to look upon the landscapes mentioned in order to be
sure of the exact meaning of the words of description
as they were used by the great poet. Hence, in Spain,
France, Italy, Egypt, Greece, and Germany, he
sought the places mentioned by Goethe in his works,
and noted the correctness or error of his reading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
The mountain scenes, more especially of the Hartz
Mountains, and “The Brocken,” were peculiarly difficult
passages in view of the possibly double meaning
of many words when found in any connection, and in
view of the peculiar use which Goethe so independently
made of them. Hence, Mr. Taylor made
frequent excursions in Europe during the last eighteen
years, with the purpose in view of obtaining a more
accurate knowledge of Goethe’s thoughts. Frequent
references are made to customs now obsolete, to theological
opinions now unknown, and words inserted
long out of use or wholly made by the poet himself.
All these required much study.</p>

<p>To know the poet necessitated a thorough insight
into the history of his time, a knowledge of his companions
and the circumstances under which the poem
was planned and written. This led to the study of
Schiller’s life, who was Goethe’s bosom friend, and to
trips to the localities where Goethe resided. Thus the
work opened wider and wider at each stage in his
acquirements, until at last the poem he had thought to
be able to read understandingly in a year, was as yet
untranslated after a score of years.</p>

<p>He was probably assisted much by the previous
translations, and had them to criticise and improve
upon. But his work was higher than theirs, as he not
only purposed to give the meaning and rhyme, but he
intended, as far as possible, to retain the rhythmical
arrangement, and secure to the English all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
charms of arrangement and sound of the German
original.</p>

<p>In this work he was often interrupted by the calls of
an editorial profession, and the cares of a correspondent.
His greatest delays were occasioned, however,
by the production of poems on other themes. He is
said to have had the “Deukalion” in mind for more than
fifteen years, and upon that last work of a notable
character which he has completed he bestowed much
careful thought. It is a poem which, like those of
Shakespeare and Goethe, grows valuable in proportion
to the study bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>He began this translation in 1850 in a vague, uncertain
way, and has continued it through all those years
and did not lost sight of it throughout all his various
duties, cares, and diversions. Meantime, he had published
the following works: “A Journey to Central
Africa,” “The Lands of the Saracen,” and “Poems
and Ballads,” in 1855. “Visit to India, China, and
Japan,” “Poems of the Orient,” and “Poems of Home
and Travel,” in 1855. “Cyclopedia of Modern Travel,”
edited in 1856. “Northern Travel—Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, and Lapland,” 1857. “Travels in
Greece and Russia,” “At Home and Abroad,” first
series, in 1859. “At Home and Abroad,” second
series, and “The Poet’s Journal,” in 1862. “Hannah
Thurston,” a novel, in 1863. “John Godfrey’s Fortunes,”
a novel, in 1864. “The Story of Kennett,” a
novel, and “The Picture of Saint John,” a poem, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
1866. “Colorado, a Summer Trip,” and edited a
translation of the “Frithjof Saga,” from the Swedish,
in 1867. “The Byways of Europe,” and the “Ballad
of Abraham Lincoln,” and an edited edition of Auerbach’s
“Villa on the Rhine,” in 1869. “Joseph and
His Friends,” a novel, in 1870. Then appeared
“Goethe’s Faust,” in 1871, followed by “The Masque
of the Gods” (1872), and a collected and carefully
edited edition of the “Illustrated Library of Travel,
Exploration and Adventure,” and “Lars,” a poem, in
1873;—all of which were in his mind, more or less
distinctly, previous to the publication of “Faust.” But
“The History of Germany,” “The Boys of other Countries,”
“Egypt and Iceland,” a volume of travel, “The
Prophet,” and “Home Pastorals,” poems, as well as
the recent poem of “Deukalion,” and “The Echo
Club,” were subsequently conceived and written.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, how full of interruptions the
work of translation must have been when so many
volumes, so many thousands miles of travel, so much
editorial work, so many lectures, such need of money,
and so much attention given to the construction of a
home, all intervened to distract and discourage.</p>

<p>Yet, with a perseverance most laudable and remarkable,
he kept ever before him Goethe and his works.
Of the merits of his translation no final judgment can
be given until the public have had more time to study
the work, and until a greater number of scholars have
compared it with the original. It has received great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
commendation; but such a work requires age, and
much thought. Its beauties lie deep, and are hidden
from superficial minds, and it was Mr. Taylor’s plan to
follow the translation with a companion edition of the
lives of Goethe and Schiller, which would in a pleasant
way serve to expound and make attractive that great
poem.</p>

<p>That his translation is regarded by the most distinguished
scholars as an excellent production and worthy
of an exalted position in literature, is shown by the
fact that he has been so often urged by them to go on
with his purposed biography of that great poet. No
sooner had Mr. Taylor allowed the fact to become
known, that he was engaged on such a book, than he
was the recipient of many letters from all parts of the
world where English-speaking people live, expressing
their satisfaction that he had undertaken it, and
encouraging him in many ways. This fact, however,
rather delayed than assisted the work, for the appearance
of so many great writers awaiting with impatience
the publication of the book, startled him and magnified
the importance of his labors. He felt that the
combined biography of Goethe and Schiller would be
the crowning work of his life, and more than once
expressed the thought that it might be his last. To
supply the demand for present publications, perform
the duties which devolved upon him in his high office,
and keep steadily advancing with the greater work,
required more strength than one frame could supply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
He felt the strain, and sometimes thought it best to
leave everything in the line of labor, and rest. The
need of such a course did not, however, seem imperative
until he was too near his end to ward off the blow.
Death came to him in the midst of his work, and in
the most sudden manner. One day he is seen at his
work; the next he is numbered among those that have
lived—but are gone. His wife and daughter (Lillian),
with most devoted nursing, had seen the invalid
of the previous weeks reviving and gaining strength,
until able again to attend to business, when, almost
without warning, he sinks and dies within a few hours.</p>

<p>The book for reference, the packages of manuscript,
the letters from admirers of Goethe and Schiller, the
notes and extracts, slips and pictures, lay where he
placed them, accessible to his hand; but the pen is
unmoved, the author is dead, and the Lives of Goethe
and Schiller are incomplete.</p>

</div>

<p>The news of Bayard Taylor’s death called forth
universal expressions of regret. The press, secular
and religious, mentioned his decease with extended
editorial comment upon his useful and honorable life.
Public meetings were held to pay tribute to his memory,
and the Congress of the United States passed a
bill making Mrs. Taylor a gift of seven thousand dollars,
as a mark of the nation’s appreciation of Mr.
Taylor’s services.</p>

<p>In Germany, memorial services were held, at which
the greatest literary men of that empire made addresses,
showing their appreciation of Mr. Taylor’s
friendship and scholarship. But one of the most
touching tributes which Germany has given to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
memory of the deceased poet, was uttered by the celebrated
Berthold Auerbach, whose books are now found
in the libraries of many different nations, and who was
for many years the intimate companion of Mr. Taylor.
In his address made at Mr. Taylor’s funeral in Berlin,
where were gathered a large number of such men as
Dr. Joseph P. Thompson, Prof. Lepsius, Paul Lindau,
Julius Rodenberg, Prof. Gneist, Dr. Lowe, Count
Lehndorff, and numerous government officials, he thus
addressed the mourning friends:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here, under flowers which have grown on German soil,
rests the perishable encasing wherein for fifty-three years
was enshrined the richly-endowed spirit which bore the name
of Bayard Taylor. Coming races will name thee who never
looked into thy kindly countenance, never grasped thy honest
hand, never heard a word from thy mouth. And yet no,
the breath of the lips fadeth away, but thy words, thy
words of song, will endure. In exhortation to thy surviving
dear ones, from the impulse of my heart as thine oldest
friend in the Old World, as thou were wont to call me, and
as representing German literature, I bid thee now a parting
farewell. What thou hast become and art to remain in the
empire of mind history will determine. To-day our hearts
do quake with grief and sorrow, and yet they are exalted.
Thou wert born in the fatherland of Benjamin Franklin, and
like him, to thine honor, raised thyself from a state of
manual labor to be an apostle of the spirit of purity and
freedom, and to be a representative of thy people among an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
alien nation. No, not in a land of strangers, for thou wert
at home among us; thou hast died in the land of Goethe, to
whose high spirit thou didst always with devotion turn;
thou hast raised him up a monument before thine own people,
and wouldst erect him yet another in presence of all
men; but that design has disappeared with thee. But thou
thyself hast been, and art still, one of them whose coming
he announced—a disciple of the universal literature, in the
free and boundless air of which the everlasting element in
man, scorning the limits of nationality, mounts on bold,
adventurous flights and ever on new poetic fancies sunwards
soars. In thy very latest work thou didst show thou livedst
in that religion which embraces in it all creeds, and in the
name of no one separates one from another. Nature gifted
thee with grace and strength, with a soul clear and full of
chaste enjoyment, with melody and the tuneful voice to
search and proclaim the workings of nature in the eternal
and unexhausted region of being, as well as to sing the
earthly and ever-new joys of married and filial love, of
friendship, truth, and patriotism, and the ever higher ascending
revelations of the history of man. Born in the New
World, travelled in the Old, and oh, so soon torn from the
tree of life, thou hast taught thy country the history of the
German people, so that they know each other as brothers,
and of this let us remain mindful. In tuneful words didst
thou for thy people utter the jubilee acclaim of their anniversary.
When it returns, and the husks of our souls do lie
like this one here, then will the lips of millions yet unborn
pronounce the name of Bayard Taylor. May thy memory
be blessed.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of his poems Mr. Taylor wrote, in 1862,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Fame won at home is of all fame the best,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And how gratifying has it been to all of Mr. Taylor’s
friends to hear of the memorial gathering held in his
native Kennett, where young and old vied with each
other to do their townsman honor. With a modesty
and sincerity characteristic of the quiet community,
they assembled and talked of the virtues and achievements
of their deceased neighbor.</p>

<p>One townsman (Edwin Brosius) referred to Mr.
Taylor’s life, and in his remarks spoke thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Locating in Kennett Square about the time he returned
from his first visit to Europe, I remember him as a bright,
blushing, diffident youth, just entering manhood; and with
him I always associate that gentle and beautiful girl, with
matchless eyes, who inspired many of his early lyrics, and
whose death ‘filled the nest of love with snow.’ He was
the pride of the community then, and as years passed on
his course was silently watched with a quiet joy, like that a
parent feels for a child that seems to follow instinctively the
true path. His appointment as Minister to Germany created
a feeling that could be silent no longer, and here in this hall
we gave him the first ovation. No one thought that when
we said ‘Kennett rejoices that the world acknowledges her
son,’ that it would so soon be meet to say that Kennett
mourns that her son is dead. Yes, mourns with a grief like
that which he felt when he wrote ‘Moan, ye wild winds!
around the pane.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“The weariness that oppressed him while being fêted
on every hand, which he thought was only temporary,
proved to be the shadow of the coming change. A few
more months and a few more warnings, and all was over.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The strings are silent: who shall dare to wake them;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Though later deeds demand their living powers?</div>
<div class="verse">Silent in other lands, what hand shall make them</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Leap as of old to shape the songs of ours?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Perhaps I have now said enough; but permit me to
speak briefly of one, still mentally bright under the weight
of fourscore years, the mother of Bayard Taylor, to whom
we must be indebted for much of the honor her son has
given us. The latent genius of the mother was more fully
developed in the son, and guarded, strengthened, and encouraged
by her watchful mind, he became all that she could
desire. When here at school, I remember how bright I
thought she was, and my admiration was not lessened when
she called me one of her boys. The voices of two of her
sons are now silent in the tomb. One taken when full of
hope, in the bloom of youth, while defending his country’s
flag. The other in the full fruitage of mature life, bearing
many honors, and the pillar of the family, a loss to her
which she cannot tell. We may speak or write our grief,
but no human pen or tongue can express hers; words cannot
tell how nearly the light of hope goes out when such
treasures are taken from a mother’s sight and heart.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another friend (Wm. B. Preston) contributed a
poem, in which two stanzas read as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Another neighbor (William W. Polk) gave an
extended sketch of Mr. Taylor’s career, and another
neighbor (Edward Swayne) contributed the second
poem, opening with,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“On the margin of the Spree</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous friends addressed the gathering; there were
hymns, quotations, and letters from others, and the
whole people exhibited an interest in honoring his
memory.</p>

<p>At Boston, Mass., there was held, shortly after Mr.
Taylor’s death, one of the most notable gatherings ever
seen in America, so spontaneous and universal was
the desire to do honor to their deceased countryman.
The gathering was in Tremont Temple, and was under
the auspices of a literary association known as “The
Boston Young Men’s Congress.” The young men
studiously avoided any arrangement or announcement
which would give the gathering any appearance of
display or ceremony, and the friends of Mr. Taylor in
that city came together in such numbers, that long
before the hour appointed for the opening of the meeting,
that great hall was crowded in every part, while
immense crowds so choked the entrances that the
police were obliged to close the gates and shut out the
throng. The great majority of the audience consisted
of literary persons and of officials of the State and
nation. Russell H. Conwell presided, and opened the
exercises by giving a brief sketch of Mr. Taylor’s
early life, after which there followed other informal
addresses by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes; Richard
Frothingham, the historian; A. B. Alcott, the author;
J. Boyle O’Reilly, the poet; Hon. J. B. D. Cogswell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the president of the Massachusetts Senate;
Curtis Guild, the author; Dr. William M. Cornell, and
others. Letters were read from James T. Fields,
George William Curtis, W. D. Howells, E. P. Whipple,
John G. Whittier, T. B. Aldrich, and regrets
for their inability to be present expressed by President
Rutherford B. Hayes, Hon. Charles Devens, ex-Governor
Henry Howard, of Rhode Island, General B. F.
Butler, Richard H. Dana, Sr., W. A. Simmons, W.
F. Warren, D. D., Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton,
Governor Thomas Talbot, of Massachusetts, and many
other distinguished men.</p>

<p>The crowning feature of the evening’s exercises consisted
in the reading of Longfellow’s poem, “Bayard
Taylor,” by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. The audience,
hushed into almost breathless silence, hung upon
Dr. Holmes’s introductory remarks, with a fascination
seldom seen, and when that sweet poem was reached,
and its reading began, tears were seen in many eyes,
so pathetic and solemn was the impression.</p>

<p>The grand chorus of the Boston Mendelssohn Choral
Union, under the direction of Prof. Stephen A. Emery,
of the New England Conservatory of Music, sang in
a most artistic and impressive manner some of those
charming old German chorals which Mr. Taylor loved
so much, and pleased the audience much with its rendition
of “Oh, for the wings of a Dove,” with Mr.
Wilkie and Miss Fisher as soloists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can show the regard in which Mr. Taylor
was held, better than the contributions to that informal
gathering, and we cannot do less than preserve some
of them for the benefit of posterity, especially as it
was that gathering which suggested this book.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes’s address was nearly as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I can hardly ask your attention to the lines which Mr.
Longfellow has written, and done me the honor of asking
me to read, without a few words of introduction. The poem
should have flowed from his own lips in those winning
accents too rarely heard in any assembly, and never forgotten
by those who have listened to him. But its tenderness
and sweetness are such that no imperfection of utterance
can quite spoil its harmonies. There are tones in the contralto
of our beloved poet’s melodious song that were born
with it, and must die with it when its music is silenced.</p>

<p>“A tribute from such a singer would honor the obsequies
of the proudest sovereign, would add freshness to the laurels
of the mightiest conqueror. But he who this evening has
this tribute laid upon his hearse, wore no crown save that
which the sisterhood of the Muses wove for him. His victories
were all peaceful ones, and there has been no heartache
after any of them. His life was a journey through
many lands of men, through many realms of knowledge.
He left his humble door in boyhood, poor, untrained,
unknown, unheralded, unattended. He found himself, once
at least, as I well remember his telling me, hungry and well-nigh
penniless in the streets of an European city, feasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
his eyes at a baker’s window and tightening his girdle in
place of a repast. Once more he left his native land, now
in the strength of manhood, known and honored throughout
the world of letters, the sovereignty of the nation investing
him with its mantle of dignity, the laws of civilization surrounding
him with the halo of their inviolable sanctity,—the
boy who went forth to view the world afoot, now on
equal footing with, the potentates and princes who, by right
of birth or by the might of intellect, swayed the destinies

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>:—As you have introduced me as ‘The
Historian of Pennsylvania,’ or, ‘Penn’s Woods,’ as you
know the term means, you will allow me to say something
of that good old noble Commonwealth which gave birth to
Bayard Taylor, whose recent and sudden demise has called
us together. As he was a worthy son of that Quaker land,
something about it may be expected of their historian. I
know the Quakers have never had much love for Boston,
and I do not think they are to blame for it either; for
if you had treated me as they were treated in this vicinity,
with all the grace given me I don’t think my love for
you would superabound. But we will not revive, on this
solemn occasion, the bigotry and illiberality of the past,
especially as this vast audience, assembled in this old Pilgrim
city to honor the memory of a gifted son of Quakerdom,
looks very much like ‘bringing forth fruits meet for
repentance’ of those deeds of yore.</p>

<p>“Grand old Pennsylvania! the keystone of the nation;
for you all know the old proverb, ‘As goes Pennsylvania,
so goes the Union,—I honor thy name! Thy sons are
patriots! The Indian sachem said to the first ‘pale faces’
who came here (understand, I speak as a Pennsylvanian, in
accordance with my introduction), ‘This is our ground.
We came up right out of this ground, and it is <em>our</em> ground.
You came up out of ground away beyond the big waters,
and that’s your ground.’</p>

<p>“Bayard Taylor, the poet, the traveller, the biographer,
the botanist, the patriot, the plenipotentiary, whom we so
justly mourn, came up out of this land. He was a true son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of our soil, which has always produced patriots. Think you
President Hayes did not know this when he appointed him
Minister to that grand old nation, Germany,—the land of
Emperor William, and Minister Bismarck,—the most learned
in the world? The President did honor to himself by this
appointment, and Bayard Taylor did honor to our nation,
and is mourned by the whole world.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:—I am not able to attend the memorial
meeting in Tremont Temple on the 10th instant, but my
heart responds to any testimonial appreciative of the intellectual
achievements and the noble and manly life of Bayard
Taylor. More than thirty years have intervened between
my first meeting him in the fresh bloom of his youth and
hope and honorable ambition, and my last parting with him
under the elms of Boston Common after our visit to Richard
H. Dana, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of that
honored father of American poetry, still living to lament the
death of his younger disciple and friend. How much he has
accomplished in these years! The most industrious of men,
slowly, patiently, under many disadvantages, he built up his
splendid reputation. Traveller, editor, novelist, translator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
diplomatist, and through all and above all poet, what he was
he owed wholly to himself. His native honesty was satisfied
with no half tasks. He finished as he went, and always said
and did his best.</p>

<p>“It is perhaps too early to assign him his place in American
literature. His picturesque books of travel, his Oriental
lyrics, his Pennsylvanian idyls, his Centennial ode, the
pastoral beauty and Christian sweetness of ‘Lars,’ and the
high arguments and rhythmic marvel of ‘Deukalion,’ are
sureties of the permanence of his reputation. But at this
moment my thoughts dwell rather upon the man than author.
The calamity of his death, felt in both hemispheres, is to me
and to all who intimately knew and loved him, a heavy personal
loss. Under the shadow of this bereavement, in the
inner circle of mourning, we sorrow most of all that we shall
see his face no more, and long for ‘the touch of a vanished
hand and the sound of a voice that is still.’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Committee of the Taylor Memorial</span>:—An
imperative duty calls me to a distant county of
the State on the evening set apart for the meeting at Tremont
Temple. But even if I were not obliged to be absent from
our city on that night, I doubt if I should have the courage
to be present and trust my voice with any words fitting to
such an occasion. The departure of my dear Bayard Taylor
is so recent, his loss so unexpected, that my lips could only
falter out a few broken expressions of individual sorrow,
and I should be wholly incapable of any adequate public
tribute to his memory. So many years of exceptional and
near relationship with him—a brotherly intercourse, unclouded
from early manhood onward through his life—would
incapacitate me from taking part before an audience assembled
to honor his genius and his virtues, and I should
probably be able only to stammer through tears an apology
for my inability to speak his praises. These tender words
by Halleck better convey my meaning:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I am very sorry that my engagements
compel me to decline your invitation to attend the meeting
in memory of Bayard Taylor. But no one will say any word
of praise of his manly and generous character, or of gratitude
for his noble example of faithful industry, to which my
heart will not respond. I knew him well for nearly thirty
years, and when I said good-by to him last May, as he departed,
amid universal applause and satisfaction, upon a
mission to Germany, he was as frank and simple and earnest
as the youth whom I remember long ago. He died in the
fulness of his activity and hope; but the death of a man so
true and upright leaves us a sorrow wholly unmixed with the
wish that his life might have been different, or with regret
that it was only a promise. Like the knight-at-arms, whose
name he bore, he was a gentle knight of letters, without fear
and without reproach, and by those of us who personally
knew him well he will be long and tenderly remembered.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—Nothing but an imperative engagement
elsewhere could keep me from uniting with those friends of
my friend—Bayard Taylor—who propose next Friday, in
Boston, to commemorate his life and virtues. From our
professional association, I could not but know him intimately,
and he was one of the few men of distinction with
whom every added year of intimacy continued to brighten,
not merely your affection, but also your respect. The
essential characteristic alike of his life, and his work, was
its inherent honesty. He described what he saw; he wrote
what he thought; he meant friendship if he gave you his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
hand. I never knew him to shrink from expressing an
opinion, merely because it was unpopular; and, I am sure,
he never sought a man merely because the man was powerful.
He had an honest pride in what he had done,—a pride
that made him eager to share his good fame and fortune
with his earliest and humblest friends. He had the genius
of hard work. He did many things; he came to do most
of them extremely well, and not a few of them easily; but
he never undertook any task, however familiar, or however
humble, without doing his best. Those who did not know
him, have sometimes described him as more German than
American; but if these be German qualities, we may well
be eager to see them naturalized.</p>

<p>“Quick to the praise of his old Quaker friends, nothing
touched him more than the praise of Boston; and to those
that prize his memory, nothing now can be more grateful
than the sympathetic appreciation of your meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor had been a great favorite at the Century
Club, in New York, and a frequent visitor at the Lotus
Club of the same city. He was usually accompanied
by some one or two of his intimate friends, and at the
time Mr. Taylor’s death was announced, several of
them who had been known to be his close companions
were requested to give to the “Tribune” letters of
“reminiscences” for publication. Among these thus
hastily collected tributes were several of those which
follow. Mr. Richard H. Stoddard said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have known Mr. Bayard Taylor so long that I hardly
know when our acquaintance began. It was at least thirty
years ago, during his first year’s residence in New York, after
his tour in Europe and the publication of his ‘Views Afoot.’
The occasion of our acquaintance was a magazine which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
lately been started here, and which was edited by Mrs.
Caroline M. Kirkland, one of my earliest and best literary
friends. I had contributed to this periodical, which was
entitled ‘The Union Magazine,’ and on her departure
for Europe she recommended me to call upon her young
friend, Mr. Taylor, who was to take care of it for her during
her absence. She was sure I would like him, for we
were <i lang="la">Arcades ambo</i>. I called upon him, and liked him, as
she had foreseen I would. I found him in the editorial
room of the ‘Tribune,’ a dingy, dusty, comfortless den on
the same floor with the composing-room, if I remember
rightly. He was seated on the hither side of an old ink-stained
desk, which was surrounded by a railing, over which
newspapers were flung, and was writing rapidly. He looked
up when I addressed him and stated my errand—a bright,
joyous, handsome man of twenty-five, with a world of
animation in his sparkling dark eyes. I have no recollection
of what passed between us, except that the poem which
was in his hands was accepted, and that we had taken a
fancy to each other. I went away feeling happy, for I felt
that I had made a friend, and one who could sympathize
with me. There were two bonds between us—love of verse,
and equality of years. He was the first man of letters who
had treated me like one of the craft, and I was grateful to
him, as I should have been, for I was weary of the intellectual
snobbery I had undergone from others.</p>

<p>“It was not long before we were what Burns calls ‘bosom
cronies.’ We used, I remember, to spend our Saturday
evenings together, generally at his rooms, which were within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
a stone’s throw of the ‘Tribune’ office, at a boardinghouse
in Warren Street, not far from Broadway. He lived
in a sky parlor, which is present before me now, as if I had
seen it but an hour ago. I remember just where his table
stood, and the little desk upon which he afterward wrote
so many books, and upon which he was then writing so
many charming poems. I took up the collected edition of
his poetical works this afternoon in my library, and turning
over the leaves sorrowfully, felt the weight of thirty years
roll from me—not lightly, as it would have done a few
weeks ago, but with a pain for which I have no words.
They were all there, the poems which I remembered so well—‘Ariel
in the Cloven Pine’ (which I read in MS. before
it saw the light of print), ‘The Metempsychosis of the
Pine,’ ‘Mon-da-min’ (which was written years before the
‘Song of Hiawatha’), ‘Kubleh,’and, saddest of all, the
solemn dirge beginning ‘Moan, ye wild winds! around the
pane.” As I read, I saw the eager face, the glowing eyes,
the kindly smile of the enthusiastic young poet, whom the
world preferred to consider as a traveller merely, and who
knew so many things of which I was profoundly ignorant.
My nature is not a reverent one, I fear, but I looked up to
Bayard Taylor, and admired his beautiful genius. We read
and criticised each other’s verse a good deal too lightly and
generously, I have since thought, and talked of the poets
whom we were studying. It was his fancy that there was
something in his genius which was allied to that of Shelley,
and I hoped that I might claim some relationship with Keats,
enough at least to make me a ‘poor relation.’ We talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
long and late; we smoked mild cigars; and, once in a while
when our exchequers were replenished, we indulged in the
sweet luxury of stewed oysters, over which we had more
talk, of present plans and future renown. I was, I believe,
Bayard Taylor’s most intimate friend at this time, and the
one with whom he most consorted, though he had, of course,
a large literary acquaintance among the young writers of
the period, whose name was Legion, and whose works are
now forgotten. I have spent many happy nights with my
dead friend, but none which were so happy as those. I
looked forward to them as young men look forward to holidays
which they have planned. I look back upon them as
old men look back to their past delights, with pity and
regret.</p>

<p>“The world, as I have said, considered Bayard Taylor as
a traveller, and it was his pleasure, as well as his profit,
during the first years of our friendship, to travel largely in
California, in Egypt, in Japan, and elsewhere in the Old
World. I read his letters of travel as they appeared in the
‘Tribune,’ and I read these letters again which he collected
thus in books after his return. I saw that they were good
of their kind; I felt that his prose was admirable for its
simplicity and correctness; but, with a waywardness which
I could not help, I slighted them for his poetry. I thought
then, and think still, that his ‘California Ballads’ and
‘Poems of Travel’ are masterly examples of spirited, picturesque
writing, and I am sure that his ‘Poems of the
Orient’ are superior to anything of the kind in the English
language. They have a local color which is absent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
‘Lalla Rookh.’ The ‘Bedouin Song,’ for instance, is
instinct with the fiery, passionate life of the East, and is a
worthy companion-piece to Shelley’s ‘Lines to an Indian
Air.’ The ‘Poems of the Orient’ were dedicated to me, I
shall always be happy to remember, in a poetical ‘Epistle
from Tmolus.’</p>

<p>“Bayard Taylor had a sunny nature, which delighted in
simple pleasures, and he had the happy art of putting
trouble away from him. One trouble, however, he could
not put away, as those who are familiar with his life and
poems are aware. I have spoken of one of his early poems
(‘Moan, ye wild winds! around the pane’), which embodied
the first great sorrow of his young manhood. It was written
after the death of his first wife, whose memory it embalms,
and whose tender presence haunted him later in
‘The Mystery’ and ‘The Phantom.’ Among the literary
acquaintances of Bayard Taylor and myself, I must not forget
to mention the late Fitz James O’Brien, whose promise
was greater than his performance, and who, clever as he
was in prose, was at his best a graceful poet. Taylor and
O’Brien were in the habit of meeting in my rooms at night,
about twenty-five years ago, and of fighting triangular
poetical duels. We used to sit at the same table, with the
names of poetical subjects on slips of paper, and drawing
out one at random, see which of us would soonest write a
poem upon it. This practice of ours, which is well enough
as practice merely, was the origin of Bayard Taylor’s ‘Echo
Club.’</p>

<p>“Always a charming companion, Bayard Taylor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
delightful in his own home at Cedarcroft. I remember visiting
him there when he gave his ‘house-warming,’ and the
merriment we had over a play which we wrote together,
speech by speech, and scene by scene, and which we performed
to the great delectation of his friends and neighbors.
Many of the latter had never seen a theatrical performance
before, and, I dare say, have never seen one since. Our
play was a great success, and ought to have been, for there
was not a word in it which had not done duty a thousand
times before! We called it ‘Love in a Hotel.’ ‘Miller
Redivivus’ would have answered just as well, if not better.</p>

<p>“The recollections of thirty years cannot be recalled at
will, and seldom while those who shared them with us are
overshadowed by death.” I remember merry days and nights
without number, and I remember sorrows which are better
forgotten. One of my sorrows was deeply felt by Bayard
Taylor, who, fresh from the reading of the second part of
‘Faust,’ saw in my loss a vision of Goethe’s ‘Euphorion.’</p>

<p>“The last time, but one, when I saw my friend alone
was three or four nights before his departure for Berlin. It
was one night at my own house, at a little gathering to
which I had invited our common friends, comrades of ten
and twenty years’ standing, poets, artists, and good fellows
of both sexes. It was notable on one account, for our
great poet Bryant came thither to do honor to his younger
brother, Bayard Taylor. I cannot say that it was a happy
night, for it was to be followed by an absence which was
close at hand,—an absence which was to endure forever.
Before two months had passed, the Nestor of our poets was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
gathered to his fathers in the fullness of his renown. His
sons bewailed their father; my good friend Stedman, in a
noble poem in the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ and Bayard Taylor in
a solemn ‘Epicedium’ in ‘Scribner’s Monthly.’ And now
Bayard Taylor is gone!</p>

<p>“‘Insatiate archer, could not one suffice?’ The world
of American letters has lost a poet in Bayard Taylor; but
we who knew and loved him—have lost a friend.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Edmund C. Stedman, the poet, who enjoyed
a very close intimacy with Mr. Taylor, spoke of him
to the editor as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The causes which led to his death at this time, date back
several years. When he returned from Europe then, he
found his real estate and personal property largely depreciated
and encumbered, and though near the age of fifty, he again
found himself forced to tolerable hard work to support his
family and position. It was this hard work, coupled with
his resolute purpose, however other work might engross him,
to keep up his more serious contributions to permanent
literature, that ultimately led to his death. He took great
pride in his home and broad acres, at Kennett Square, Penn.,
his native place. He designed his own house, ‘Cedarcroft,’
and spent a great deal of money in its erection, and
that, with the two hundred acres of land, which he owned
and had greatly improved, was a source of expense rather
than income to him. He had a handsome competence when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
he went abroad, all of which he earned as a journalist,
author, and lecturer, never having earned any money except
by his pen. He decided to maintain his property in Kennett
Square, and he set to work immediately to pay off the
debt. During the last four years, he has accomplished this, his
income amounting to from $12,000 to $18,000 a year; but
he obtained it by very hard work. In fact, he had worked
harder and accomplished more in that time than perhaps any
other living literary man. He lectured each winter, in all sorts
of weather, and in different parts of the country. He contributed
largely to magazines and reviews, and never more
brilliantly, besides doing a great amount of regular work
for the ‘Tribune.’ He came from a long-lived family, and
his strength was very great, but he undertook too much. He
did the work of two able-bodied men every day, and his
health gave way under the great strain on one or two
occasions. He was compelled to go to the White Sulphur
Springs, and other places for recuperation; but he forced
himself to work again before he had fully recovered. During
this time he wrote his last and most important poem,
‘Prince Deukalion.’ It was a source of great trial to himself,
and of regret to his friends, that he was unable to go
on with his ‘Life of Goethe,’ for which he had secured material
during his last sojourn in Germany. The great trouble
with him was his inability, owing to his excessive labors, to
take sufficient social recreation. His enemies, very few in
number, have falsely attempted to make a point against him
on this account, charging him with excessive beer-drinking.
It was his want of recreation and rest that killed him. He
was forced to take some stimulus to support himself under
exhausting labor; but he was not an excessive beer-drinker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
as he has been charged, though what he did take may have
helped to develop his disease.</p>

<p>“No man in the country could do so much journalistic
work, and do it so well in a given time, as could Mr. Taylor.
He was remarkable in brilliant off-hand feats of literary
criticism. As an illustration, I might mention that
about a year ago two large octavo volumes, containing
poems by Victor Hugo, in the French, arrived by steamer, and
were placed in Mr. Taylor’s hands on Thursday evening. For
some reason it was desirable that the criticism should appear
in the ‘Tribune’ of the following Saturday, and, of course,
the copy had to be in the printers’ hands early on Friday
night. Mr. Taylor’s health was bad at the time, and he
also had in the meantime to deliver a lecture in Brooklyn,
and another in New York. He finished his review in time
on Friday night, and it appeared in the ‘Tribune’ the following
morning, covering more than two-thirds of a page.
It was equal to any of his literary criticisms, and surpassed
any analysis of Hugo’s genius that I have ever seen. One
remarkable feature of the review was over a column of
translation into English poetry from the original, including
several lyrics and idyls so beautifully done that they seemed
like original poems in the English.</p>

<p>“Mr. Taylor was a man of wide and thorough learning,
and was a much more exact scholar than would be supposed,
considering that he was never at college, and spent
a great deal of time in travel and observation. He had a
smattering of all languages. He was familiar with Latin
and Greek, spoke French well, and German like a native;
he also conversed in Russian, Norse, Arabic, Italian, and
knew something of modern Greek. His knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Greek was increased by his classical feeling, which, as with
Keats, amounted almost to a passion. He was a good
botanist, and somewhat of a geologist, and was an established
authority on geographical questions. He was greatly
interested in all scientific studies.</p>

<p>“As a man he was a peer among his fellows. He was
the most simple, generous-hearted man of letters I ever
knew. He was the first literary man I met in New York,
my acquaintance dating from the time he came and took me
by the hand in 1860, after the publication of one of my
articles. He was never so happy as when surrounded by
his friends in his own house. He had unbounded hospitality,
and made his house the centre of literary life in the city.
New York will greatly miss him, and just such a leader was
needed to give encouragement to our literary life. He was
accused sometimes of egotism; but he was not egotistical
in the proper sense of the term. He was frank and out-spoken,
and showed his feelings plainly, which gave rise to
that charge. He always denounced shams and humbugs;
but I do not believe he ever did a mean act, and he never
grew angry except on account of the meanness of others.</p>

<p>“His private letters, of which I had a great number, were
far more delightful than his published ones. He was very
careful in his published letters not to say anything that
might wound the feelings of distinguished persons from
whom he received hospitality abroad. His private letters
are full of the most interesting anecdotes and conversations
with leading authors and magnates of other lands, and are
charming in their clearness and <i lang="fr">esprit</i>. His faults, and we
all have them, were rather of a lovable nature. He cared
most for his reputation as a poet, and his books on travel
and novels were a secondary matter with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Taylor did not seek the appointment as Minister to
Germany, but other positions were tendered him which he
declined, and this was offered rather in obedience to popular
demand. Mr. Taylor, Mr. Boker, and Mr. Stoddard
started together in literary life thirty years ago, and they
have always worked together, and have been firm friends.
It was a rather curious coincidence that Mr. Boker should
follow as Minister Mr. Taylor as Charge d’Affairs in Russia,
and that just as Boker returned from Russia, Mr. Taylor
should be sent as Minister to Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Samuel Coleman, the artist, said of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I first knew Mr. Taylor nearly twenty years ago, and
my acquaintance with him has always been of the pleasantest
kind. I shall never forget a visit that I made to his home
at Kennett Square, in 1861, in company with a brother
artist. Much of our conversation was on art subjects, and
in the evening Mr. Taylor read to me with great gusto some
poems written by an extravagant Southern writer. He read
the poems in a manner that showed his keen appreciation of
’ the comic element, and kept us laughing at the passages
which the author had intended to be most dramatic. Mr.
Taylor was a most genial host, and knew how to keep a
room full of persons in the happiest mood. His speeches
and his manner at such times cannot be described.</p>

<p>“In art matters Mr. Taylor was thoroughly at home.
He could not only write a good criticism of a painting, but
he was also proficient in the use of brush and pencil. He
began sketching when he was a boy, and he executed many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
paintings in water-colors. He was made one of the members
of the Water-Color Society soon after the society was
started. Several of his works were shown at the annual
exhibitions of the society, and were much admired. I met
Mr. Taylor by appointment at Florence, Italy, in the spring
of 1873, and visited with him for a short time in that city.
We had talked of making a journey to Egypt together. I
was to do some sketching there, while he was to glean
materials for a book. Ill-health prevented me from making
the proposed journey at that time, and I left him in
Florence. He there occupied the rooms where Mrs.
Browning had lived.</p>

<p>“In later years I had not seen so much of Mr. Taylor as
I had wished. I remember the brilliant part he played in
the Twelfth Night entertainment of the Century Club last
winter, when he put on a high conical cap and marched
about the room beating a large drum. As on many other
occasions, his wit was displayed in comical speeches and
retorts that kept his listeners laughing by the hour. I saw
him for the last time at the house of a friend, when he
spoke earnestly of the many happy associations he was
about to leave. His heart was in this country, however
much his interests might lie abroad.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Charles T. Congdon, an associate on the
“Tribune,” wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Everybody in the office knew how high Mr. Taylor
stood in the estimation of Mr. Greeley. A man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
worked his way up; who, beginning as a printer, had come
to be an admired writer, who was ambitious of excellence,
and not afraid of toil to attain it, Mr. Greeley was naturally
fond of. So, when the monument of the great journalist
was to be dedicated, Mr. Taylor was properly selected to
make one of the principal addresses on the occasion. How
good that address was, how well conceived and arranged
and delivered, need not be said to those who had the satisfaction
of hearing it. It was indeed an impressive occasion
when, standing above the tomb of his old master, surrounded
by those to whom that noble man was dear, with the liberal
sky stretched over the earnest speaker, and the great, busy
city in the distance, Mr. Taylor, in manly words and
sonorous voice, paid those glowing tributes to which all our
hearts responded. Somebody now must speak for him; but
his memory will lack no eulogist. There is enough to say
of such a vigorous and wise career; something, too, there
is, alas! which must be left unsaid. Of any of us who
remain, had our fate been his, he would have spoken kind
and generous words; nor should he go to his grave ‘without
the meed of one melodious tear.’</p>

<p>“After many years had gone by, Mr. Taylor came back
to do regular daily work in the ‘Tribune’ office, and this he
continued until his departure for Germany. I was near
him, and, if there were any need of it, I could speak again of
his unflagging industry, and of his excellent qualities as a
journalist. He had the faculty which every newspaper
writer should possess, of writing fairly well upon any topic
confided to him. Of course his special skill was displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in literary labor; but when he saw fit to write upon what
may be called secular themes, he did so in an able and
judicious way. He was thoroughly kind and obliging, and
always willing to lend his help, or to give his advice when
it was asked for, as it often was. Somehow, I cannot get
away from the impression of his untiring assiduity. He
seemed to have always a great variety of work in hand—work
at home and in the office—as if he had caught something
of the power of toiling from that great German upon
whose biography he was then engaged. If he was somewhat
proud of his accomplishments—thinking over the matter
more, I see that he had a right to be—he had done much,
and he had done it well, and he was entitled to the indulgence
of some complacency.</p>

<p>“When the rumor came that Mr. Taylor was to be taken
away from us for a time and advanced to high diplomatic
honors, I think that we were all as proud of it as he was,
and felt it to be a recognition, not perhaps made too soon,
of the importance of journalism. It was something to send
forth from among ourselves an Ambassador to the German
Empire, and we were personally grateful to the powers at
Washington, though we thought them also the obliged party.
In our own way, and in our own place, and with a small
token of our good-will, we bade Mr. Taylor farewell on that
April afternoon, and spoke jestingly of the time when, his
court-dress put off, we should welcome him back to his old
desk. There came a statelier leave-taking afterward, when
so many of the best and most distinguished of our citizens
met to take leave of him in a more formal manner; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
think that he prized our little demonstration quite as highly,
and thought of it afterward on the sea and in foreign lands
quite as often.</p>

<p>“A man must be judged by what is best in him, by what
he has really done, and not by the accidents of his
character. Few Americans have written more, and
more variously, than Mr. Taylor, and few have written
better. Those of us who know how he owed nothing to
chance, how methodical and painstaking he was, how he
conquered difficulties which would have dismayed a weaker
man, are in a position to judge of his merits, and to accord
to him words of praise, little as he needs them, which have
a specific meaning.”</p>

</div>

<p>James T. Fields, in the tributes published in the
“Tribune,” gave this sketch of the acquaintance and
friendship existing between Mr. Taylor and himself:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The death of a man like Bayard Taylor, awakens universal
sorrow. Throughout the land of his birth a tearful
grief has overspread the nation, and he is mourned everywhere,
far and wide, in America. There never lived a public
man of greater <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>, or of a franker disposition. He
had many honors to bear, but he bore them meekly, and like
an unspoiled child. Cynicism and vulgar egotism were
strangers to his truthful nature; there were no jarring
chords either in his understanding or his heart, and so he
became his country’s favorite, as well as her pride.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two years ago, on a bright spring morning, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
young man of twenty-three held out his hand to me, and introduced
himself as Bayard Taylor. We had corresponded
at intervals since his first little volume was published in 1844,
but we had never met until then. He had come to Boston,
rather unexpectedly, he said, to see Longfellow, and Holmes,
and Whipple, and some others, who had expressed an interest
in his ‘Views Afoot,’ then recently printed in book-form.
No one could possibly look upon the manly young
fellow at that time without loving him. He was tall and
slight, with the bloom of youth mantling a face full of eager,
joyous expectation. Health of that buoyant nature which
betokens delight in existence, was visible in every feature of
the youthful traveller.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘The fresh air lodged within his cheek</div>
<div class="verse">As light within a cloud.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“We all flocked about him like a swarm of brothers, heartily
welcoming him to Boston. When we told him how charmed
we all were with his travels, he blushed like a girl, and tears
filled his sensitive eyes. ‘It is one of the most absorbingly
interesting books I ever read!’ cried one of our number,
heightening the remark with an expletive savoring more of
strength that of early piety. Taylor looked up, full of happiness
at the opinion so earnestly expressed, and asked, with
that simple naivete which always belonged to his character,
‘Do you really think so? Well, I am <em>so</em> glad.’</p>

<p>“Then we began to lay out plans for a week’s holiday with
him; to-morrow we would go to such a place down the harbor;
next day to another point of interest; after that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
would all assemble at a supper party in his honor, at Parker’s
(at that time a subterranean eating-house in Court
Street), and following that festivity we would take him to
see old Booth in <cite>Richard</cite>. We went on filling up the seven
days with our designs upon him, when he protested, with an
explosive shout of laughter, that he must be back again in
New York the next day. Then we showered warm exhortations
upon him to postpone his exit, but he assured us that
go back he must, for he had promised to do so. Well, then,
if that were the case, and we saw by his countenance that
he meant what he said, we must adjourn at once to ‘Webster’s,’
a famous beefsteak house in those ancient days, and,
as Whipple facetiously remarked, quoting the old ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Put a steak in his inside</div>
<div class="verse">Where the four cross-roads did meet.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“So thitherward we rollicked along into Washington Street,
and performed that pleasant duty, Taylor all the while
brimming over with radiant spirits, his young heart already
illumined with the delight of recognition and praise.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon we handed him over to Longfellow, whom
he was anxious to meet, and who gave him such a welcome
as he never forgot. In one of the last conversations I had
with Taylor, a few weeks before he sailed for the Embassy,
he said, with deep feeling: ‘From the first, Longfellow has
been to me the truest and most affectionate friend that ever
man had. He always gives me courage to go on, and never
fails to lift me forward into hopeful regions whenever I meet
him. He is the dearest soul in the world, and my love for
him is unbounded.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whittier, Holmes, Emerson, Hawthorne, among many
others in New England, always rejoiced to see Taylor’s welcome
face returning to us. Whenever he came to lecture in
Boston or Cambridge, it was the signal for happy dinners
and merry meetings at each other’s houses. His fiftieth birthday
occurring during one of these visits to Boston, was celebrated
by an informal dinner in my own house, at which
Longfellow proposed his health, and Holmes garlanded him
with pleasurable words of friendship and praise.</p>

<p>“When Taylor came here to give his lectures on German
literature, at the ‘Lowell Institute,’ the crowd was so great
that hundreds were unable to gain admittance. Those
masterly delineations of the genius and character of Goethe,
Schiller, Klopstock, Lessing, and other famous men of Germany,
will long be remembered here, and we were all looking
forward to no remote period when we should again hear
his voice on kindred topics in the same place. No discourses
have ever been listened to in Boston with more enthusiasm,
or have been oftener referred to with delight, since they were
delivered. Bayard Taylor was not only honored and respected
here for his genius,—he was everywhere beloved.
His death saddens our city, and is the absorbing topic in
every circle.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Taylor’s body arrived in New York on the thirteenth
day of March, about three months after his death,
and was received with imposing ceremonies of respect.
Committees from distinguished citizens and prominent
associations received the remains at the steamship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
wharf and a large procession followed the elegant
funeral-car to the City Hall. The coffin was placed in
the Governor’s room in the City Hall, where an address
was delivered by the Hon. Algernon S. Sullivan.
Delegations were present from the Grand Army of the
Republic; from the Delta Kappa Epsilon societies;
the German singing societies; from the State Legislature;
the National Congress, and hundreds of men
and women distinguished more or less in literary and
official life. Salutes were fired from the fort, dirges
were sung by German associations, flags were placed
at half-mast, and the immense crowd of people seeking
admittance to City Hall, showed the esteem in which
the distinguished minister was held.</p>

<p>The body lay in state at the City Hall, with a guard
from the Grand Army of the Republic, until noon of
the 14th, when the body was removed, amid touching
and imposing ceremonies, to the railway train
which conveyed it to Kennett Square.</p>

<p>There have been but few incidents of American life
more pathetic and remarkable than the spontaneous
exhibition of love and admiration by the people of Mr.
Taylor’s native town, when his body was taken there
for burial. The silent and uncovered crowds, the
tears, the regrets, the stories of his kindness, the
honest acts of deference, the noble reception of any
one who had been his friend, all served to make up a
most unusual tribute to the memory of a great man.
In many places the funeral of Mr. Taylor had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
attracted the attention which his friends have felt was
due to his memory. But at his old home, among his
own kin, in the circle of those who knew him best, old
and young came forth to do him honor. Aged men
and women, whose white hairs floated in the chilly
breezes, and young children, whose hats and bonnets
were held so modestly behind them, bowed their heads
as the sombre procession passed them.</p>

<p>The services at Cedarcroft on the 15th were short
and simple, being conducted by the Rev. W. H. Furness,
D. D., after which Dr. Franklin Taylor made a
brief address.</p>

<p>At the grave in Longwood Cemetery, about a mile
and a half from Cedarcroft, there were gathered thousands
of mourning acquaintances, who listened in solemn
silence to the addresses which were there delivered
by Dr. Furness, and by Mr. Edmund C. Stedman,
and the reading of the burial service according to the
rites of the Protestant Episcopal Church, by the Rev.
H. N. Powers. The pall-bearers consisted of eight
persons: George H. Boker, of Philadelphia; Richard
H. Stoddard, of New York; Edmund C. Stedman, of
New York; Whitelaw Reid, of New York; J. Taylor
Gause, of Wilmington, Delaware; Jacob P. Cox, of
Kennett; James M. Phillips, of Kennett; Marshall
Swayne, of Kennett, and Edward Needles of West
Chester, Pa. Governor Hoyt of Pennsylvania, a delegation
from the Legislature of Pennsylvania, representatives
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Society, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
kindred associations were present, with a large number
of friends from distant parts of the country.</p>

<p>It was an impressive scene. The aged father, the sisters,
the brothers, the officials, and the throng of other
friends around the open grave! From that neighborhood
he went forth into life, a frail farmer-boy, less
promising than many of his playmates. Now, after
twoscore of years, in which he had made for himself
friends in every clime, and a name in literature, oratory
and diplomacy, his body is laid to rest amid universal
grief, and bearing on its coffin-lid the floral
tributes from the Empress, and from the greatest men
of Germany, and from the most gifted men and
women of his own land.</p>

<p>Beside the grave stood his intimate friend and loved
companion, Edmund C. Stedman, who, perhaps, more
than any other living man had enjoyed the deceased
poet’s confidence. It was fitting that he should pay
the closing tribute to his friend’s career. Then a choir
of neighbors sang a burial ode, the words and music
being written for the occasion, the former by Mrs. S.
L. Oberholtzer, and the latter by John E. Sweney.
Slowly and reverently amid sobs and tears,—a multitude
weeping,—they laid him tenderly in his last
resting-place, near the grave of his brave brother, and
beside the remains of his first love.</p>

<p>The address of Mr. Stedman was nearly as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Three months have gone since we heard from a distant
land that the spirit of our comrade had departed. His life
was eager, noble, wide-renowned. It lasted for more than
half a century, yet ceased prematurely, and we say, “He
should have died hereafter!” Here, to-day, at this very
spot, the mould which held that spirit returns to the self-same
earth which nurtured it. Here the mortal journeyings
are forever ended. The seas, the deserts, the mountain-ranges,
shall be crossed no more; the joyous eyes are
veiled; the near, warm heart can throb no longer; the stalwart
frame has fallen, and henceforth lies at rest. For us
the record is closed; but is it ended without a continuance?
This is the question, which here, at this moment, in this
place, so strongly comes to each one of those who were his
comrades, whom he loved with all his generous nature, to
whom he was ever stanch and true, for whom he would at
all times have given all he had, from whom only his dust
now can receive the love, the tender utterance, the ceaseless
remembrance which they seek to offer in return. Are the
travels then in truth forever ended? Shall there be, for our
brother, no more insatiable thirst for knowledge, no more
high poetic speech, no more looking toward the stars? For
one, I try to answer from his own lips, since they so often
foretokened it. If ever a longing for eternal life, a resolve
not to be deprived of action, a beautiful and absolute faith
that the Power which governs all had decreed that these
should not surcease—if these ever have given a mortal a
hold on immortality, then our Bayard still is living, though
above and beyond us. For however dimmed may be the
vision wherewith some of us strive in vain, whatever our
hopes, to look behind the veil, for him there was neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
doubt nor darkness. He could not, would not, tolerate the
idea of one-sided individuality. I have never known a man
whose trust in this one thing was so absolutely and always
unshaken, or who had a more abiding, sustaining faith in
the perfection of the universal plan and in the beneficence
of its Designer.</p>

<p>Such was his religion, and I say that it was constant and
most beautiful. Possibly it was something of the Quaker
breed within him that made him so conscious of the Spirit,
and so natural and unfailing a believer in direct inspiration.
In this age of questionings and searchings, how few of
those who profess the most have his perfect faith in that
immortality whose promise animates the creeds! For this
alone the most rigid may revere his religion, and even without
this his spotless life of purity, philanthropy, heroic
deeds, has been a model for those who seek to become the
disciples of whom the Teacher said, “By their fruits ye
shall know them.” This is the one statement which I desire
to make. This much, at this final place and hour, I am
moved to affirm. Joyous poet, loyal comrade, patient and
generous brother in toil and song—Farewell! Farewell!</p>

</div>

<p>With two quotations from Bayard Taylor’s writings,
one of prose and one of poetry, the writer will lay
down his pen (weary with rapid writing), and with
the feeling that the subject of this volume is too vast
to be adequately or comprehensively treated so soon
after his death; and hoping that a lack of completeness
in this book, may not argue a lack of affection on
the part of the writer. These are Bayard Taylor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
words. How like a benediction they come to us as
we close this book.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These are the rules which I have always accepted:
First, labor; nothing can be had for nothing; whatever a
man achieves, he must pay for; and no favor of fortune
can absolve him from his duty. Secondly, patience and
forbearance, which is simply dependent on the slow justice
of time. Thirdly, and most important, faith. Unless a
man believe in something far higher than himself; something
infinitely purer and grander than he can ever become—unless
he has an instinct of an order beyond his dreams; of
laws beyond his comprehension; of beauty and goodness
and justice, beside which his own ideals are dark, he will
fail in every loftier form of ambition, and ought to fail.”</p>
